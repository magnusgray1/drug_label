54904,43685-7,Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug which can be used in the treatment of epilepsy.,0
54905,43685-7,The primary site of action appears to be the motor cortex where spread of seizure activity is inhibited.,0
54906,43685-7,"Possibly by promoting sodium efflux from neurons, phenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient.",0
54907,43685-7,This includes the reduction of posttetanic potentiation at synapses.,0
54908,43685-7,Loss of posttetanic potentiation prevents cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas.,0
54909,43685-7,Phenytoin reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic phase of tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures.,0
54910,43685-7,"The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours.",0
54911,43685-7,Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day.,0
54912,43685-7,"When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved.",0
54913,43685-7,Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose.,0
54914,43685-7,Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration.,0
54915,43685-7,For extended phenytoin sodium capsules peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration.,0
54916,43685-7,"Optimum control without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum levels between 10 and 20 mcg/mL, although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin.",0
54917,43685-7,"In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved.",0
54918,43685-7,There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages.,0
54919,43685-7,Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin.,0
54920,43685-7,"Unusually high levels result from liver disease, congenital enzyme deficiency, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference.",0
54921,43685-7,"The patient with large variations in phenytoin plasma levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem.",0
54922,43685-7,Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful.,0
54923,43685-7,"As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal.",0
54924,43685-7,Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine.,0
54925,43685-7,Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but more importantly by tubular secretion.,0
54926,43685-7,"Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high plasma levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range.",0
54927,43685-7,"The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more.",0
54928,43685-7,"Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are indicated for the control of generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) and complex partial (psychomotor, temporal lobe) seizures and prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during or following neurosurgery.",0

54932,43685-7,"When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually.",0
54933,43685-7,"However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary.",0
54934,43685-7,"In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class.",0

54937,43685-7,"Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo.",0
54938,43685-7,"In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated.",0
54939,43685-7,"There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.",0
54940,43685-7,The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed.,0
54941,43685-7,"Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.",0
54942,43685-7,The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed.,0
54943,43685-7,The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication.,0
54944,43685-7,The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.,0
54945,43685-7,Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.,0
54946,43685-7,"The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.",0
54947,43685-7,Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin sodium or any other AED must balance this risk with the risk of untreated illness.,0
54948,43685-7,Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.,0
54949,43685-7,"Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.",0
54950,43685-7,"Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm.",0
54951,43685-7,Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.,0
54952,43685-7,"There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s Disease.",0

54958,43685-7,An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics.,0
54959,43685-7,Periodic measurement of plasma phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests).,0
54960,43685-7,"However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated.",0
54961,43685-7,"If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus.",0
54962,43685-7,Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes.,0
54963,43685-7,"Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), minor anomalies (dysmorphic facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia), growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and mental deficiency have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.",0

54965,43685-7,"The overall incidence of malformations for children of epileptic women treated with antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin and/or others) during pregnancy is about 10%, or 2-to 3-fold that in the general population.",0
54966,43685-7,"However, the relative contributions of antiepileptic drugs and other factors associated with epilepsy to this increased risk are uncertain and in most cases it has not been possible to attribute specific developmental abnormalities to particular antiepileptic drugs.",0
54967,43685-7,Patients should consult with their physicians to weigh the risks and benefits of phenytoin during pregnancy.,0
54968,43685-7,A potentially life threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero.,0
54969,43685-7,This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth.,0
54970,43685-7,Increased resorption and malformation rates have been reported following administration of phenytoin doses of 75 mg/kg or higher (approximately 120% of the maximum human loading dose or higher on a mg/m2 basis) to pregnant rabbits.,0
54971,43685-7,"The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity.",0
54972,43685-7,A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly.,0
54973,43685-7,Slow metabolism may be due to limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined.,0
54974,43685-7,Phenytoin should be discontinued if a skin rash appears (see WARNINGS section regarding drug discontinuation).,0
54975,43685-7,"If the rash is exfoliative, purpuric, or bullous, or if lupus erythematosus, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis is suspected, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.",0

55004,43685-7,There are many drugs which may increase or decrease phenytoin levels or which phenytoin may affect.,0
55005,43685-7,Serum level determinations for phenytoin are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected.,0
55006,43685-7,The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below.,0

55015,43685-7,Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin plasma levels.,0
55016,43685-7,It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation.,0
55017,43685-7,More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients.,0
55018,43685-7,Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of T4.,0

55049,43685-7,Death is due to respiratory and circulatory depression.,0
55050,43685-7,There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin plasma levels where toxicity may occur.,0
55051,43685-7,"Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the plasma concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity.",0
55052,43685-7,As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery.,0
55053,43685-7,Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote.,0
55054,43685-7,The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed.,0

66987,43685-7,Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers [see also Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].,0
66988,43685-7,"Prescriptions for Lexapro should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.",0
66989,43685-7,Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder,0
66990,43685-7,A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder.,0
66991,43685-7,It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder.,0
66992,43685-7,Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown.,0
66993,43685-7,"However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.",0
66994,43685-7,It should be noted that Lexapro is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.,0
66995,43685-7,"The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including Lexapro treatment, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists.",0
66996,43685-7,"Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).",0
66997,43685-7,"Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes.",0
66998,43685-7,Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.,0
66999,43685-7,The concomitant use of Lexapro with MAOIs intended to treat depression is contraindicated.,0
67000,43685-7,"If concomitant treatment of Lexapro with a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist (triptan) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.",0
67001,43685-7,The concomitant use of Lexapro with serotonin precursors (such as tryptophan) is not recommended.,0
67002,43685-7,"Treatment with Lexapro and any concomitant serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.",0
67003,43685-7,"During marketing of Lexapro and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania.",0
67004,43685-7,"While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.",0
67005,43685-7,Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with Lexapro.,0
67006,43685-7,A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible.,0
67007,43685-7,"If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered.",0
67008,43685-7,"Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].",0
67009,43685-7,"Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, Lexapro has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder.",0
67010,43685-7,These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing.,0
67011,43685-7,"In clinical trials of Lexapro, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with Lexapro treatment.",0
67012,43685-7,"Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, Lexapro should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.",0
67013,43685-7,"In placebo-controlled trials of Lexapro in major depressive disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in one (0.1%) of 715 patients treated with Lexapro and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo.",0
67014,43685-7,One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with Lexapro treatment.,0
67015,43685-7,Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder.,0
67016,43685-7,"As with all drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, Lexapro should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania.",0
67017,43685-7,"Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including Lexapro.",0
67018,43685-7,"In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and was reversible when Lexapro was discontinued.",0
67019,43685-7,Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported.,0
67020,43685-7,Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs.,0
67021,43685-7,"Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk [see Geriatric Use (8.5 )].",0
67022,43685-7,Discontinuation of Lexapro should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.,0
67023,43685-7,"Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls.",0
67024,43685-7,"Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.",0
67025,43685-7,"SSRIs and SNRIs, including Lexapro, may increase the risk of bleeding events.",0
67026,43685-7,"Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to the risk.",0
67027,43685-7,Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding.,0
67028,43685-7,"Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.",0
67029,43685-7,"Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Lexapro and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation.",0
67030,43685-7,"In a study in normal volunteers, Lexapro 10 mg/day did not produce impairment of intellectual function or psychomotor performance.",0
67031,43685-7,"Because any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, however, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Lexapro therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.",0
67032,43685-7,Clinical experience with Lexapro in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited.,0
67033,43685-7,Caution is advisable in using Lexapro in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or hemodynamic responses.,0
67034,43685-7,Lexapro has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease.,0
67035,43685-7,Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing.,0
67036,43685-7,"In subjects with hepatic impairment, clearance of racemic citalopram was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased.",0
67037,43685-7,The recommended dose of Lexapro in hepatically impaired patients is 10 mg/day [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].,0
67038,43685-7,"Because escitalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination.",0
67039,43685-7,"Until adequate numbers of patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with Lexapro, however, it should be used with caution in such patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].",0
67040,43685-7,"In patients receiving serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma.",0
67041,43685-7,These reactions have also been reported in patients who have recently discontinued SSRI treatment and have been started on an MAOI.,0
67042,43685-7,Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome.,0
67043,43685-7,"Furthermore, limited animal data on the effects of combined use of SSRIs and MAOIs suggest that these drugs may act synergistically to elevate blood pressure and evoke behavioral excitation.",0
67044,43685-7,"Therefore, it is recommended that Lexapro should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI.",0
67045,43685-7,"Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping Lexapro before starting an MAOI.",0
67046,43685-7,"Serotonin syndrome has been reported in two patients who were concomitantly receiving linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI.",0
67508,43685-7,Symptomatic response with KAPIDEX does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.,0
70905,43685-7,5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions,0
70906,43685-7,"At higher than recommended doses , Exelon Patch (rivastigmine transdermal system) use is associated with significant gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including nausea , vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia/decreased appetite and weight loss.",0
70907,43685-7,"For this re ason, patients administered Exelon Patch should always be started at a dose of 4.6 mg/24 hours and titrated to th e maintenance dose of 9.5 mg/24 hours .",0
70908,43685-7,"If treatment is interrupted for longer than several days, treatment should be reinitia ted with the lowest daily dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ] to reduce the possibility of severe vomiting and its potentially serious sequelae (e.g., there has been one post-marketing report of severe vomiting with esophageal rupture following inappropriate reinitiation of treatment with a 4.5-mg dose of an oral formulation after 8 weeks of treatment interruption).",0
70909,43685-7,"At higher than recommended doses , c aregivers should be advised of the high incidence of nausea and vomiting associated with the use of Exelon Patch along with the possibility of anorexia and weight loss .",0

70932,43685-7,Peptic Ulcers/Gastrointestinal Bleeding,0
70933,43685-7,"Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity.",0
70934,43685-7,"Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).",0

133306,43685-7,"If the drug is reinstituted, it should be done with caution since these acute CNS manifestations may recur.",0
133307,43685-7,Caution should be used when pentazocine is administered to patients prone to seizures; seizures have occurred in a few such patients in association with the use of pentazocine though no cause and effect relationship has been established.,0
133308,43685-7,Decreased metabolism of pentazocine by the liver in extensive liver disease may predispose to accentuation of side effects.,0

409307,43685-7,"Complex behaviors such as ""sleep-driving"" (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with amnesia for the event) have been reported with sedative-hypnotics, including zolpidem.",0
409308,43685-7,These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-naive as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons.,0
409309,43685-7,"Although behaviors such as ""sleep-driving"" may occur with zolpidem tartrate tablets alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with zolpidem tartrate tablets appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of zolpidem tartrate tablets at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose.",0
409310,43685-7,"Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate tablets should be strongly considered for patients who report a ""sleep-driving"" episode.",0

409327,43685-7,Use in the elderly and/or debilitated patients: Impaired motor and/or cognitive performance after repeated exposure or unusual sensitivity to sedative/hypnotic drugs is a concern in the treatment of elderly and/or debilitated patients.,0
409328,43685-7,"Therefore, the recommended zolpidem tartrate tablets dosage is 5 mg in such patients to decrease the possibility of side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].",0
409329,43685-7,These patients should be closely monitored.,0
409330,43685-7,Use in patients with concomitant illness: Clinical experience with zolpidem tartrate tablets in patients with concomitant systemic illness is limited.,0

1224097,43685-7,These include a spectrum of withdrawal symptoms; the most important is seizure (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).,0
1224098,43685-7,"Even after relatively short-term use at the doses recommended for the treatment of transient anxiety and anxiety disorder (ie, 0.75 to 4.0 mg per day), there is some risk of dependence.",0
1224099,43685-7,Spontaneous reporting system data suggest that the risk of dependence and its severity appear to be greater in patients treated with doses greater than 4 mg/day and for long periods (more than 12 weeks).,0
1224100,43685-7,"However, in a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients, the duration of treatment (3 months compared to 6 months) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose.",0

1224102,43685-7,"The importance of dose and the risks of alprazolam as a treatment for panic disorder: Because the management of panic disorder often requires the use of average daily doses of alprazolam above 4 mg, the risk of dependence among panic disorder patients may be higher than that among those treated for less severe anxiety.",0
1224103,43685-7,Experience in randomized placebo-controlled discontinuation studies of patients with panic disorder showed a high rate of rebound and withdrawal symptoms in patients treated with alprazolam compared to placebo-treated patients.,0
1224104,43685-7,Relapse or return of illness was defined as a return of symptoms characteristic of panic disorder (primarily panic attacks) to levels approximately equal to those seen at baseline before active treatment was initiated.,0
1224105,43685-7,"Rebound refers to a return of symptoms of panic disorder to a level substantially greater in frequency, or more severe in intensity than seen at baseline.",0
1224106,43685-7,Withdrawal symptoms were identified as those which were generally not characteristic of panic disorder and which occurred for the first time more frequently during discontinuation than at baseline.,0
1224107,43685-7,"In a controlled clinical trial in which 63 patients were randomized to alprazolam and where withdrawal symptoms were specifically sought, the following were identified as symptoms of withdrawal: heightened sensory perception, impaired concentration, dysosmia, clouded sensorium, paresthesias, muscle cramps, muscle twitch, diarrhea, blurred vision, appetite decrease, and weight loss.",0
1224108,43685-7,"Other symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, were frequently seen during discontinuation, but it could not be determined if they were due to return of illness, rebound, or withdrawal.",0
1224109,43685-7,"In two controlled trials of 6 to 8 weeks duration where the ability of patients to discontinue medication was measured, 71% to 93% of patients treated with alprazolam tapered completely off therapy compared to 89% to 96% of placebo-treated patients.",0
1224110,43685-7,"In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients, the duration of treatment (3 months compared to 6 months) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose.",0
1224111,43685-7,Seizures attributable to alprazolam were seen after drug discontinuance or dose reduction in 8 of 1980 patients with panic disorder or in patients participating in clinical trials where doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day for over 3 months were permitted.,0
1224112,43685-7,"Five of these cases clearly occurred during abrupt dose reduction, or discontinuation from daily doses of 2 to 10 mg. Three cases occurred in situations where there was not a clear relationship to abrupt dose reduction or discontinuation.",0
1224113,43685-7,"In one instance, seizure occurred after discontinuation from a single dose of 1 mg after tapering at a rate of 1 mg every 3 days from 6 mg daily.",0
1224114,43685-7,"In two other instances, the relationship to taper is indeterminate; in both of these cases the patients had been receiving doses of 3 mg daily prior to seizure.",0
1224115,43685-7,The duration of use in the above 8 cases ranged from 4 to 22 weeks.,0
1224116,43685-7,There have been occasional voluntary reports of patients developing seizures while apparently tapering gradually from alprazolam.,0
1224117,43685-7,The risk of seizure seems to be greatest 24 to 72 hours after discontinuation (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for recommended tapering and discontinuation schedule).,0
1224118,43685-7,Status Epilepticus and its Treatment,0
1224119,43685-7,The medical event voluntary reporting system shows that withdrawal seizures have been reported in association with the discontinuation of alprazolam.,0
1224120,43685-7,"In most cases, only a single seizure was reported; however, multiple seizures and status epilepticus were reported as well.",0
1224121,43685-7,Interdose Symptoms,0
1224122,43685-7,Early morning anxiety and emergence of anxiety symptoms between doses of alprazolam have been reported in patients with panic disorder taking prescribed maintenance doses of alprazolam.,0
1224123,43685-7,These symptoms may reflect the development of tolerance or a time interval between doses which is longer than the duration of clinical action of the administered dose.,0
1224124,43685-7,"In either case, it is presumed that the prescribed dose is not sufficient to maintain plasma levels above those needed to prevent relapse, rebound or withdrawal symptoms over the entire course of the interdosing interval.",0
1224125,43685-7,"In these situations, it is recommended that the same total daily dose be given divided as more frequent administrations (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).",0
1224126,43685-7,Risk of Dose Reduction,0
1224127,43685-7,Withdrawal reactions may occur when dosage reduction occurs for any reason.,0
1224128,43685-7,"This includes purposeful tapering, but also inadvertent reduction of dose (eg, the patient forgets, the patient is admitted to a hospital).",0
1224129,43685-7,"Therefore, the dosage of alprazolam should be reduced or discontinued gradually (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).",0
1224130,43685-7,CNS Depression and Impaired Performance,0
1224131,43685-7,"Because of its CNS depressant effects, patients receiving alprazolam should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.",0
1224132,43685-7,"For the same reason, patients should be cautioned about the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs during treatment with alprazolam.",0
1224133,43685-7,Risk of Fetal Harm,0
1224134,43685-7,Benzodiazepines can potentially cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women.,0
1224135,43685-7,"If alprazolam is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.",0
1224136,43685-7,"Because of experience with other members of the benzodiazepine class, alprazolam is assumed to be capable of causing an increased risk of congenital abnormalities when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester.",0
1224137,43685-7,"Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency, their use during the first trimester should almost always be avoided.",0
1224139,43685-7,Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physicians about the desirability of discontinuing the drug.,0
1224140,43685-7,Alprazolam Interaction with Drugs that Inhibit Metabolism via Cytochrome P4503A,0
1224141,43685-7,The initial step in alprazolam metabolism is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A).,0
1224142,43685-7,Drugs that inhibit this metabolic pathway may have a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam.,0
1224143,43685-7,"Consequently, alprazolam should be avoided in patients receiving very potent inhibitors of CYP3A.",0
1224144,43685-7,"With drugs inhibiting CYP3A to a lesser but still significant degree, alprazolam should be used only with caution and consideration of appropriate dosage reduction.",0
1224145,43685-7,"For some drugs, an interaction with alprazolam has been quantified with clinical data; for other drugs, interactions are predicted from in vitro data and/or experience with similar drugs in the same pharmacologic class.",0
1224146,43685-7,"The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of alprazolam and/or related benzodiazepines, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A.",0
1224147,43685-7,Potent CYP3A Inhibitors,0
1224148,43685-7,"Azole antifungal agents — Ketoconazole and itraconazole are potent CYP3A inhibitors and have been shown in vivo to increase plasma alprazolam concentrations 3.98 fold and 2.70 fold, respectively.",0
1224149,43685-7,The coadministration of alprazolam with these agents is not recommended.,0
1224150,43685-7,Other azole-type antifungal agents should also be considered potent CYP3A inhibitors and the coadministration of alprazolam with them is not recommended (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).,0
1224151,43685-7,Drugs demonstrated to be CYP 3A inhibitors on the basis of clinical studies involving alprazolam (caution and consideration of appropriate alprazolam dose reduction are recommended during coadministration with the following drugs),0
1224152,43685-7,Nefazodone — Coadministration of nefazodone increased alprazolam concentration two-fold.,0
1224153,43685-7,"Fluvoxamine — Coadministration of fluvoxamine approximately doubled the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam, decreased clearance by 49%, increased half-life by 71%, and decreased measured psychomotor performance.",0
1224154,43685-7,"Cimetidine— Coadministration of cimetidine increased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 86%, decreased clearance by 42%, and increased half-life by 16%.",0

1224183,43685-7,"Benzodiazepines, even when used as recommended, may produce emotional and/or physical dependence.",0
1224184,43685-7,"Do not stop taking this medication abruptly or decrease the dose without consulting your physician, since withdrawal symptoms can occur.",0
1224185,43685-7,Additional advice for panic disorder patients:,0

1237946,43685-7,"The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric.",0
1237948,43685-7,"Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.",0
1237949,43685-7,"If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].",0
1237950,43685-7,"Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers.",0
1237952,43685-7,"Prescriptions for fluoxetine capsules should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.",0
1237953,43685-7,It should be noted that fluoxetine is approved in the pediatric population for Major Depressive Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.,0
1237954,43685-7,Information for pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) is approved for Eli Lilly and Company’s Fluoxetine Capsules.,0
1237955,43685-7,"However due to Eli Lilly and Company’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.",0
1237956,43685-7,5.2 Serotonin Syndrome,0
1237957,43685-7,"The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John’s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).",0
1237958,43685-7,"Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).",0
1237959,43685-7,Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.,0
1237960,43685-7,The concomitant use of fluoxetine with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated.,0
1237961,43685-7,Fluoxetine should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.,0
1237962,43685-7,All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg.,0
1237963,43685-7,No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses.,0
1237964,43685-7,There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking fluoxetine.,0
1237965,43685-7,"Fluoxetine should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.9, 2.10)].",0
1237966,43685-7,"If concomitant use of fluoxetine with other serotonergic drugs, i.e., triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan and St. John’s Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.",0
1237967,43685-7,"Treatment with fluoxetine and any concomitant serotonergic agents, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.",0
1237968,43685-7,5.3 Allergic Reactions and Rash,0
1237969,43685-7,"In U.S. fluoxetine clinical trials, 7% of 10,782 patients developed various types of rashes and/or urticaria.",0
1237970,43685-7,"Among the cases of rash and/or urticaria reported in premarketing clinical trials, almost a third were withdrawn from treatment because of the rash and/or systemic signs or symptoms associated with the rash.",0
1237971,43685-7,"Clinical findings reported in association with rash include fever, leukocytosis, arthralgias, edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, respiratory distress, lymphadenopathy, proteinuria, and mild transaminase elevation.",0
1237972,43685-7,"Most patients improved promptly with discontinuation of fluoxetine and/or adjunctive treatment with antihistamines or steroids, and all patients experiencing these reactions were reported to recover completely.",0
1237973,43685-7,"In premarketing clinical trials, 2 patients are known to have developed a serious cutaneous systemic illness.",0
1237974,43685-7,"In neither patient was there an unequivocal diagnosis, but one was considered to have a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and the other, a severe desquamating syndrome that was considered variously to be a vasculitis or erythema multiforme.",0
1237975,43685-7,Other patients have had systemic syndromes suggestive of serum sickness.,0
1237976,43685-7,"Since the introduction of fluoxetine, systemic reactions, possibly related to vasculitis and including lupus-like syndrome, have developed in patients with rash.",0
1237977,43685-7,"Although these reactions are rare, they may be serious, involving the lung, kidney, or liver.",0
1237978,43685-7,Death has been reported to occur in association with these systemic reactions.,0
1237979,43685-7,"Anaphylactoid reactions, including bronchospasm, angioedema, laryngospasm, and urticaria alone and in combination, have been reported.",0
1237980,43685-7,"Pulmonary reactions, including inflammatory processes of varying histopathology and/or fibrosis, have been reported rarely.",0
1237981,43685-7,These reactions have occurred with dyspnea as the only preceding symptom.,0
1237982,43685-7,Whether these systemic reactions and rash have a common underlying cause or are due to different etiologies or pathogenic processes is not known.,0
1237983,43685-7,"Furthermore, a specific underlying immunologic basis for these reactions has not been identified.",0
1237984,43685-7,"Upon the appearance of rash or of other possibly allergic phenomena for which an alternative etiology cannot be identified, fluoxetine should be discontinued.",0
1237985,43685-7,5.4 Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder and Monitoring for Mania/Hypomania,0
1237986,43685-7,A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of Bipolar Disorder.,0
1237987,43685-7,It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for Bipolar Disorder.,0
1237988,43685-7,Whether any of the symptoms described for clinical worsening and suicide risk represent such a conversion is unknown.,0
1237989,43685-7,"However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for Bipolar Disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, Bipolar Disorder, and depression.",0
1237990,43685-7,It should be noted that fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination is approved for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder [see Warnings and Precautions section of the package insert for Symbyax].,0
1237991,43685-7,Fluoxetine monotherapy is not indicated for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder.,0
1237992,43685-7,"In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for Major Depressive Disorder, mania/hypomania was reported in 0.1% of patients treated with fluoxetine and 0.1% of patients treated with placebo.",0
1237993,43685-7,Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with Major Affective Disorder treated with other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].,0
1237994,43685-7,"In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for OCD, mania/hypomania was reported in 0.8% of patients treated with fluoxetine and no patients treated with placebo.",0

1237996,43685-7,"In U.S. fluoxetine clinical trials, 0.7% of 10,782 patients reported mania/hypomania [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].",0
1237997,43685-7,5.5 Seizures,0
1237998,43685-7,"In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for Major Depressive Disorder, convulsions (or reactions described as possibly having been seizures) were reported in 0.1% of patients treated with fluoxetine and 0.2% of patients treated with placebo.",0
1237999,43685-7,No patients reported convulsions in U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for either OCD or bulimia.,0
1238000,43685-7,"In U.S. fluoxetine clinical trials, 0.2% of 10,782 patients reported convulsions.",0
1238001,43685-7,The percentage appears to be similar to that associated with other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder.,0
1238002,43685-7,Fluoxetine should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizures.,0
1238003,43685-7,5.6 Altered Appetite and Weight,0
1238004,43685-7,"Significant weight loss, especially in underweight depressed or bulimic patients, may be an undesirable result of treatment with fluoxetine.",0
1238005,43685-7,"In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for Major Depressive Disorder, 11% of patients treated with fluoxetine and 2% of patients treated with placebo reported anorexia (decreased appetite).",0
1238006,43685-7,Weight loss was reported in 1.4% of patients treated with fluoxetine and in 0.5% of patients treated with placebo.,0
1238007,43685-7,"However, only rarely have patients discontinued treatment with fluoxetine because of anorexia or weight loss [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].",0
1238008,43685-7,"In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for OCD, 17% of patients treated with fluoxetine and 10% of patients treated with placebo reported anorexia (decreased appetite).",0
1238009,43685-7,One patient discontinued treatment with fluoxetine because of anorexia [see Use in Specific Populations(8.4)].,0
1238010,43685-7,"In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for Bulimia Nervosa, 8% of patients treated with fluoxetine 60 mg and 4% of patients treated with placebo reported anorexia (decreased appetite).",0
1238011,43685-7,Patients treated with fluoxetine 60 mg on average lost 0.45 kg compared with a gain of 0.16 kg by patients treated with placebo in the 16 week double-blind trial.,0
1238012,43685-7,Weight change should be monitored during therapy.,0
1238013,43685-7,5.7 Abnormal Bleeding,0
1238014,43685-7,"SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine, may increase the risk of bleeding reactions.",0
1238015,43685-7,"Concomitant use of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anti-coagulants may add to this risk.",0
1238017,43685-7,"Bleeding reactions related to SNRIs and SSRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.",0
1238018,43685-7,"Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of fluoxetine and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].",0
1238019,43685-7,5.8 Angle-Closure Glaucoma,0
1238020,43685-7,Angle-Closure Glaucoma — The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including fluoxetine may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.,0
1238021,43685-7,5.9 Hyponatremia,0
1238022,43685-7,"Hyponatremia has been reported during treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine.",0
1238024,43685-7,Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported and appeared to be reversible when fluoxetine was discontinued.,0
1238025,43685-7,Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs and SSRIs.,0
1238027,43685-7,Discontinuation of fluoxetine should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.,0
1238030,43685-7,5.10 Anxiety and Insomnia,0
1238031,43685-7,"In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for Major Depressive Disorder, 12% to 16% of patients treated with fluoxetine and 7% to 9% of patients treated with placebo reported anxiety, nervousness, or insomnia.",0
1238032,43685-7,"In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for OCD, insomnia was reported in 28% of patients treated with fluoxetine and in 22% of patients treated with placebo.",0
1238033,43685-7,Anxiety was reported in 14% of patients treated with fluoxetine and in 7% of patients treated with placebo.,0
1238034,43685-7,"In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for Bulimia Nervosa, insomnia was reported in 33% of patients treated with fluoxetine 60 mg, and 13% of patients treated with placebo.",0
1238035,43685-7,"Anxiety and nervousness were reported, respectively, in 15% and 11% of patients treated with fluoxetine 60 mg and in 9% and 5% of patients treated with placebo.",0
1238036,43685-7,"Among the most common adverse reactions associated with discontinuation (incidence at least twice that for placebo and at least 1% for fluoxetine in clinical trials collecting only a primary reaction associated with discontinuation) in U.S. placebo-controlled fluoxetine clinical trials were anxiety (2% in OCD), insomnia (1% in combined indications and 2% in bulimia), and nervousness (1% in Major Depressive Disorder) [see Table 5].",0
1238037,43685-7,5.11 QT Prolongation,0
1238038,43685-7,Postmarketing cases of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia including torsade de pointes have been reported in patients treated with fluoxetine.,0
1238039,43685-7,Fluoxetine should be used with caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome; a previous history of QT prolongation; a family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death; and other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia.,0
1238040,43685-7,"Such conditions include concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval; hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and other significant arrhythmias; and conditions that predispose to increased fluoxetine exposure (overdose, hepatic impairment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, or use of other highly protein-bound drugs).",0
1238041,43685-7,"Fluoxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 [see Contraindications(4.2), Drug Interactions (7.7, 7.8), Overdose (10.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",0
1238042,43685-7,Pimozide and thioridazine are contraindicated for use with fluoxetine.,0
1238043,43685-7,Avoid the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval.,0
1238044,43685-7,"These include specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol,); specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol); and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Drug Interactions (7.7, 7.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",0
1238045,43685-7,Consider ECG assessment and periodic ECG monitoring if initiating treatment with fluoxetine in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia.,0
1238046,43685-7,Consider discontinuing fluoxetine and obtaining a cardiac evaluation if patients develop signs or symptoms consistent with ventricular arrhythmia.,0
1238047,43685-7,5.12 Use in Patients With Concomitant Illness,0
1238048,43685-7,Clinical experience with fluoxetine in patients with concomitant systemic illness is limited.,0
1238049,43685-7,Caution is advisable in using fluoxetine in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses.,0
1238050,43685-7,Cardiovascular — Fluoxetine has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease.,0
1238051,43685-7,Patients with these diagnoses were systematically excluded from clinical studies during the product’s premarket testing.,0
1238052,43685-7,"However, the electrocardiograms of 312 patients who received fluoxetine in double-blind trials were retrospectively evaluated; no conduction abnormalities that resulted in heart block were observed.",0
1238053,43685-7,The mean heart rate was reduced by approximately 3 beats/min.,0
1238054,43685-7,"Glycemic Control — In patients with diabetes, fluoxetine may alter glycemic control.",0
1238055,43685-7,"Hypoglycemia has occurred during therapy with fluoxetine, and hyperglycemia has developed following discontinuation of the drug.",0
1238056,43685-7,"As is true with many other types of medication when taken concurrently by patients with diabetes, insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic, dosage may need to be adjusted when therapy with fluoxetine is instituted or discontinued.",0
1238057,43685-7,5.13 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment,0
1238058,43685-7,"As with any CNS-active drug, fluoxetine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills.",0
1238059,43685-7,"Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that the drug treatment does not affect them adversely.",0
1238060,43685-7,5.14 Long Elimination Half-Life,0
1238061,43685-7,"Because of the long elimination half-lives of the parent drug and its major active metabolite, changes in dose will not be fully reflected in plasma for several weeks, affecting both strategies for titration to final dose and withdrawal from treatment.",0
1238062,43685-7,This is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the discontinuation of fluoxetine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].,0
1238063,43685-7,5.15 Discontinuation Adverse Reactions,0
1238064,43685-7,"During marketing of fluoxetine, SNRIs, and SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania.",0
1238065,43685-7,"While these reactions are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.",0
1238066,43685-7,Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with fluoxetine.,0
1238069,43685-7,"Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.",0
1238070,43685-7,Plasma fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentration decrease gradually at the conclusion of therapy which may minimize the risk of discontinuation symptoms with this drug.,0
1238071,43685-7,5.16 Fluoxetine and Olanzapine in Combination,0
1240007,43685-7,5.1 Fetal Toxicity,0
1240008,43685-7,Pregnancy Category D,0
1240009,43685-7,Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death.,0
1240010,43685-7,Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations.,0
1240011,43685-7,"Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death.",0
1240012,43685-7,"When pregnancy is detected, discontinue valsartan as soon as possible.",0
1240013,43685-7,[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].,0
1240015,43685-7,Excessive hypotension was rarely seen (0.1%) in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with valsartan alone.,0
1240016,43685-7,"In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur.",0
1240017,43685-7,"This condition should be corrected prior to administration of valsartan, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision.",0
1240018,43685-7,Caution should be observed when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure.,0
1240019,43685-7,"Patients with heart failure given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed.",0
1240020,43685-7,"In controlled trials in heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients.",0
1240021,43685-7,"If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline.",0
1240022,43685-7,"A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.",0
1240023,43685-7,5.3 Impaired Renal Function,0
1240024,43685-7,Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics.,0
1240025,43685-7,Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g.,0
1240026,43685-7,"patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on valsartan.",0
1240027,43685-7,Monitor renal function periodically in these patients.,0
1240028,43685-7,Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on valsartan [See Drug Interactions (7)].,0
1240029,43685-7,5.4 Hyperkalemia,0
1240030,43685-7,Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium.,0
1240031,43685-7,"These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.",0

1281962,43685-7,"Like other ACE inhibitors, ramipril, has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients.",0
1281964,43685-7,Correct volume-and salt-depletion before initiating therapy with ramipril.,0
1281965,43685-7,"If excessive hypotension occurs, place the patient in a supine position and, if necessary, treat with intravenous infusion of physiological saline.",0
1281966,43685-7,Ramipril treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume.,0
1281967,43685-7,Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction,0
1281968,43685-7,"In patients with heart failure post-myocardial infarction who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of ramipril.",0
1281969,43685-7,"If the initial dose of 2.5 mg ramipril cannot be tolerated, use an initial dose of 1.25 mg ramipril to avoid excessive hypotension.",0
1281970,43685-7,Consider reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic to decrease the incidence of hypotension.,0
1281971,43685-7,Congestive Heart Failure,0
1281972,43685-7,"In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia and rarely, with acute renal failure and death.",0
1281973,43685-7,"In such patients, initiate ramipril therapy under close medical supervision and follow patients closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of ramipril or diuretic is increased.",0
1281974,43685-7,Surgery and Anesthesia,0
1281975,43685-7,"In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, ramipril may block angiotensin II formation that would otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release.",0
1281977,43685-7,5.6 Fetal Toxicity,0
1281982,43685-7,"When pregnancy is detected, discontinue ramipril as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].",0

1281986,43685-7,"Patients receiving the combination of telmisartan and ramipril did not obtain any benefit in the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke and heart failure hospitalization compared to monotherapy, but experienced an increased incidence of clinically important renal dysfunction (death, doubling of serum creatinine, or dialysis) compared with groups receiving telmisartan alone or ramipril alone.",0
1281987,43685-7,Concomitant use of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended.,0
1281988,43685-7,5.8 Hyperkalemia,0
1281989,43685-7,"In clinical trials with ramipril, hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 1% of hypertensive patients receiving ramipril.",0
1281990,43685-7,"In most cases, these were isolated values, which resolved despite continued therapy.",0
1281991,43685-7,None of these patients were discontinued from the trials because of hyperkalemia.,0
1281992,43685-7,"Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with ramipril [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].",0

1312007,43685-7,Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (depression or mood) were dose-related for epilepsy populations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].,0
1312008,43685-7,Somnolence/Fatigue,0
1312009,43685-7,Somnolence and fatigue were the adverse reactions most frequently reported during clinical trials of topiramate for adjunctive epilepsy.,0
1312010,43685-7,"For the adjunctive epilepsy population, the incidence of somnolence did not differ substantially between 200 mg/day and 1,000 mg/day, but the incidence of fatigue was dose-related and increased at dosages above 400 mg/day.",0

1312019,43685-7,"In the monotherapy epilepsy double-blind trial, 1 pediatric patient (2%) in the 50 mg/day group and 7 pediatric patients (12%) in the 400 mg/day group discontinued treatment due to any adverse reactions.",0
1312020,43685-7,The most common adverse reaction associated with discontinuation of therapy was difficulty with concentration/attention; all occurred in the 400 mg/day group.,0
1312021,43685-7,5.7 Fetal Toxicity,0
1312022,43685-7,Topiramate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.,0
1312023,43685-7,Data from pregnancy registries indicate that infants exposed to topiramate in utero have an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts).,0
1312024,43685-7,"When multiple species of pregnant animals received topiramate at clinically relevant doses, structural malformations, including craniofacial defects, and reduced fetal weights occurred in offspring [see Use in Special Populations (8.1)].",0

1312026,43685-7,Topiramate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.,0
1312027,43685-7,"If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.9)].",0
1312028,43685-7,5.8 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs),0
1312029,43685-7,"In patients with or without a history of seizures or epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs, including topiramate, should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential for seizures or increased seizure frequency [see Clinical Studies (14)].",0
1312030,43685-7,"In situations where rapid withdrawal of topiramate is medically required, appropriate monitoring is recommended.",0
1312031,43685-7,5.9 Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP),0
1312032,43685-7,"During the course of premarketing development of topiramate tablets, 10 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of treated patients (2796 subject years of exposure).",0
1312033,43685-7,This represents an incidence of 0.0035 deaths per patient year.,0
1312034,43685-7,"Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving topiramate (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of patients with epilepsy, to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the topiramate program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy).",0
1312035,43685-7,5.10 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy (Without and With Concomitant Valproic Acid [VPA] Use),0
1312036,43685-7,Hyperammonemia/Encephalopathy Without Concomitant Valproic Acid (VPA),0
1312037,43685-7,"Topiramate treatment has produced hyperammonemia in a clinical investigational program in very young pediatric patients (1 to 24 months) who were treated with adjunctive topiramate for partial onset epilepsy (8% for placebo, 10% for 5 mg/kg/day, 0% for 15 mg/kg/day, 9% for 25 mg/kg/day).",0
1312038,43685-7,"In some patients, ammonia was markedly increased (>50% above upper limit of normal).",0
1312039,43685-7,"The hyperammonemia associated with topiramate treatment occurred with and without encephalopathy in placebo-controlled trials and in an open-label, extension trial of infants with refractory epilepsy.",0
1312040,43685-7,Dose-related hyperammonemia was observed in the extension trial in pediatric patients up to 2 years old.,0
1312041,43685-7,Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting.,0
1312042,43685-7,Topiramate is not approved as adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in pediatric patients less than 2 years old.,0
1312043,43685-7,Hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy has also been observed in post-marketing reports in patients who were taking topiramate without concomitant valproic acid (VPA).,0
1312044,43685-7,Hyperammonemia/Encephalopathy With Concomitant Valproic Acid (VPA),0
1312045,43685-7,Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproic acid (VPA) has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone based upon post-marketing reports.,0
1312046,43685-7,"Although hyperammonemia may be asymptomatic, clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting.",0
1312047,43685-7,"In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug.",0
1312048,43685-7,This adverse reaction is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction.,0
1312049,43685-7,"Although topiramate is not indicated for use in infants/toddlers (1-24 months), topiramate with concomitant VPA clearly produced a dose-related increase in the incidence of treatment-emergent hyperammonemia (above the upper limit of normal, 0% for placebo, 12% for 5 mg/kg/day, 7% for 15 mg/kg/day, 17% for 25 mg/kg/day) in an investigational program.",0
1312050,43685-7,"Markedly increased, dose-related hyperammonemia (0% for placebo and 5 mg/kg/day, 7% for 15 mg/kg/day, 8% for 25 mg/kg/day) also occurred in these infants/toddlers.",0

1312052,43685-7,Hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy has also been observed in post-marketing reports in patients taking topiramate with VPA.,0
1312053,43685-7,The hyperammonemia associated with topiramate treatment appears to be more common when topiramate is used concomitantly with VPA.,0
1312054,43685-7,Monitoring for Hyperammonemia,0
1312055,43685-7,Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy.,0
1312056,43685-7,"Although not studied, topiramate treatment or an interaction of concomitant topiramate and valproic acid treatment may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons.",0

1363919,43685-7,The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed.,0
1363922,43685-7,The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanism of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication.,0

1363935,43685-7,"Patients should be closely monitored for clinical worsening (including development of new symptoms) and suicidality, especially at the beginning of a course of treatment, or at the time of dose changes.",0
1363936,43685-7,"In addition, patients with a history of suicidal behavior or thoughts, those patients exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal ideation prior to commencement of treatment, and young adults are at an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment [see Suicidal Behavior and Ideation (5.4) ].",0
1363937,43685-7,"Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients who experience clinical worsening (including development of new symptoms) and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation/behavior especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.",0
1363938,43685-7,Prescriptions for lamotrigine should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose.,0

1363941,43685-7,"Because of the potential for serious outcomes of untreated meningitis due to other causes, patients should also be evaluated for other causes of meningitis and treated as appropriate.",0
1363942,43685-7,Postmarketing cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications.,0
1363943,43685-7,"Symptoms upon presentation have included headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and nuchal rigidity.",0
1363944,43685-7,"Rash, photophobia, myalgia, chills, altered consciousness, and somnolence were also noted in some cases.",0
1363945,43685-7,Symptoms have been reported to occur within 1 day to one and a half months following the initiation of treatment.,0
1363946,43685-7,"In most cases, symptoms were reported to resolve after discontinuation of lamotrigine.",0
1363947,43685-7,Re-exposure resulted in a rapid return of symptoms (from within 30 minutes to 1 day following re-initiation of treatment) that were frequently more severe.,0
1363948,43685-7,Some of the patients treated with lamotrigine who developed aseptic meningitis had underlying diagnoses of systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases.,0
1363949,43685-7,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyzed at the time of clinical presentation in reported cases was characterized by a mild to moderate pleocytosis, normal glucose levels, and mild to moderate increase in protein.",0
1363950,43685-7,"CSF white blood cell count differentials showed a predominance of neutrophils in a majority of the cases, although a predominance of lymphocytes was reported in approximately one third of the cases.",0
1363951,43685-7,"Some patients also had new onset of signs and symptoms of involvement of other organs (predominantly hepatic and renal involvement), which may suggest that in these cases the aseptic meningitis observed was part of a hypersensitivity reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].",0
1363952,43685-7,5.7 Potential Medication ErrorsMedication errors involving lamotrigine have occurred.,0
1363953,43685-7,"In particular, the name lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications.",0
1363955,43685-7,"To reduce the potential of medication errors, write and say lamotrigine clearly.",0
1363956,43685-7,"Depictions of the lamotrigine tablets, can be found in the Medication Guide that accompanies the product to highlight the distinctive markings, colors, and shapes that serve to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help reduce the risk of medication errors.",0
1363957,43685-7,"To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are lamotrigine tablets, as well as the correct formulation of lamotrigine, each time they fill their prescription.",0
1363958,43685-7,5.8 Concomitant Use With Oral ContraceptivesSome estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].,0
1363959,43685-7,Dosage adjustments will be necessary in most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking lamotrigine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ].,0
1363960,43685-7,"During the week of inactive hormone preparation (""pill-free"" week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, as much as doubling at the end of the week.",0
1363961,43685-7,"Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels of lamotrigine, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia, could occur.",0
1363962,43685-7,"5.9 Withdrawal SeizuresAs with other AEDs, lamotrigine should not be abruptly discontinued.",0
1363963,43685-7,In patients with epilepsy there is a possibility of increasing seizure frequency.,0
1363964,43685-7,"In clinical trials in patients with Bipolar Disorder, 2 patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine; however, there were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in these bipolar patients.",0
1363965,43685-7,"Unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal, the dose of lamotrigine should be tapered over a period of at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% reduction per week) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ].",0
1363966,43685-7,5.10 Status EpilepticusValid estimates of the incidence of treatment-emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with lamotrigine are difficult to obtain because reporters participating in clinical trials did not all employ identical rules for identifying cases.,0
1363967,43685-7,"At a minimum, 7 of 2,343 adult patients had episodes that could unequivocally be described as status epilepticus.",0
1363968,43685-7,"In addition, a number of reports of variably defined episodes of seizure exacerbation (e.g., seizure clusters, seizure flurries etc.)",0
1363969,43685-7,were made.,0
1363970,43685-7,"5.11 Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP)During the premarketing development of lamotrigine, 20 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 4,700 patients with epilepsy (5,747 patient-years of exposure).",0
1363971,43685-7,"Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night.",0
1363972,43685-7,This represents an incidence of 0.0035 deaths per patient-year.,0
1363973,43685-7,"Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving lamotrigine (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of patients with epilepsy, to 0.004 for a recently studied clinical trial population similar to that in the clinical development program for lamotrigine, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy).",0
1363974,43685-7,"Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or suggest concern depends on the comparability of the populations reported upon to the cohort receiving lamotrigine and the accuracy of the estimates provided.",0
1363975,43685-7,"Probably most reassuring is the similarity of estimated SUDEP rates in patients receiving lamotrigine and those receiving other AEDs, chemically unrelated to each other, that underwent clinical testing in similar populations.",0
1363976,43685-7,"Importantly, that drug is chemically unrelated to lamotrigine.",0
1363977,43685-7,"This evidence suggests, although it certainly does not prove, that the high SUDEP rates reflect population rates, not a drug effect.",0
1363978,43685-7,"5.12 Addition of Lamotrigine to a Multidrug Regimen That Includes ValproateBecause valproate reduces the clearance of lamotrigine, the dosage of lamotrigine in the presence of valproate is less than half of that required in its absence.",0
1363979,43685-7,"5.13 Binding in the Eye and Other Melanin-Containing TissuesBecause lamotrigine binds to melanin, it could accumulate in melanin-rich tissues over time.",0
1363980,43685-7,This raises the possibility that lamotrigine may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use.,0
1363981,43685-7,"Although ophthalmological testing was performed in one controlled clinical trial, the testing was inadequate to exclude subtle effects or injury occurring after long-term exposure.",0
1363982,43685-7,"Moreover, the capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences, if any, of lamotrigine's binding to melanin is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ].",0
1363983,43685-7,"Accordingly, although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects.",0
1363984,43685-7,5.14 Laboratory TestsThe value of monitoring plasma concentrations of lamotrigine in patients treated with lamotrigine has not been established.,0
1363985,43685-7,"Because of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions between lamotrigine and other drugs including AEDs (see Table 15 ), monitoring of the plasma levels of lamotrigine and concomitant drugs may be indicated, particularly during dosage adjustments.",0
1363986,43685-7,"In general, clinical judgment should be exercised regarding monitoring of plasma levels of lamotrigine and other drugs and whether or not dosage adjustments are necessary.",0
1364620,43685-7,5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related PsychosisElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death.,0
1364621,43685-7,"Analysis of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients.",0
1364622,43685-7,"Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group.",0
1364623,43685-7,"Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature.",0
1364624,43685-7,"Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality.",0
1364625,43685-7,The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear.,0

1374983,43685-7,Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease,0
1374984,43685-7,Divalproex sodium is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder [see Contraindications (4)].,0
1374985,43685-7,"Valproate-induced acute liver failure and liver-related deaths have been reported in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by mutations in the gene for mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG) (e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) at a higher rate than those without these syndromes.",0
1374986,43685-7,Most of the reported cases of liver failure in patients with these syndromes have been identified in children and adolescents.,0
1374987,43685-7,"POLG-related disorders should be suspected in patients with a family history or suggestive symptoms of a POLG-related disorder, including but not limited to unexplained encephalopathy, refractory epilepsy (focal, myoclonic), status epilepticus at presentation, developmental delays, psychomotor regression, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, myopathy cerebellar ataxia, opthalmoplegia, or complicated migraine with occipital aura.",0
1374988,43685-7,POLG mutation testing should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice for the diagnostic evaluation of such disorders.,0
1374989,43685-7,The A467T and W748S mutations are present in approximately 2/3 of patients with autosomal recessive POLG-related disorders.,0
1374990,43685-7,"In patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, divalproex sodium should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed.",0

1374994,43685-7,5.2 Birth Defects,0
1374995,43685-7,Valproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.,0
1374996,43685-7,"Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations and malformations involving various body systems).",0
1374997,43685-7,The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure monotherapies.,0
1374998,43685-7,Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population.,0
1374999,43685-7,5.3 Decreased IQ Following in utero Exposure,0
1375000,43685-7,Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure.,0
1375001,43685-7,Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower cognitive test scores than children exposed in utero to either another antiepileptic drug or to no antiepileptic drugs.,0
1375002,43685-7,The largest of these studies1 is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 [95% C.I.,0
1375003,43685-7,94-101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C.I.,0
1375004,43685-7,"105–110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C.I.",0
1375005,43685-7,"102–108]), and phenytoin (108 [95% C.I.",0
1375006,43685-7,104–112]).,0
1375007,43685-7,It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur.,0
1375008,43685-7,"Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed.",0
1375009,43685-7,"Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that valproate exposure in utero can cause decreased IQ in children.",0
1375010,43685-7,"In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].",0
1375011,43685-7,Valproate use is contraindicated during pregnancy in women being treated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches.,0
1375012,43685-7,Women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant should not be treated with valproate unless other treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable.,0
1375013,43685-7,"In such women, the benefits of treatment with valproate during pregnancy may still outweigh the risks.",0
1375014,43685-7,5.4 Use in Women of Childbearing Potential,0
1375015,43685-7,"Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ and major congenital malformations (including neural tube defects), which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition.",0
1375016,43685-7,"This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death (e.g., migraine).",0
1375017,43685-7,Women should use effective contraception while using valproate.,0
1375018,43685-7,"Women who are planning a pregnancy should be counseled regarding the relative risks and benefits of valproate use during pregnancy, and alternative therapeutic options should be considered for these patients [see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].",0
1375019,43685-7,"To prevent major seizures, valproate should not be discontinued abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life.",0
1375021,43685-7,It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation.,0
1375022,43685-7,Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate.,0
1375023,43685-7,5.5 Pancreatitis,0
1375024,43685-7,Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate.,0
1375025,43685-7,Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with rapid progression from initial symptoms to death.,0
1375026,43685-7,Some cases have occurred shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use.,0
1375027,43685-7,The rate based upon the reported cases exceeds that expected in the general population and there have been cases in which pancreatitis recurred after rechallenge with valproate.,0
1375028,43685-7,"In clinical trials, there were 2 cases of pancreatitis without alternative etiology in 2,416 patients, representing 1,044 patient-years experience.",0
1375029,43685-7,"Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation.",0
1375030,43685-7,"If pancreatitis is diagnosed, divalproex sodium should ordinarily be discontinued.",0
1375031,43685-7,Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated [see Boxed Warning].,0
1375032,43685-7,5.6 Urea Cycle Disorders,0
1375033,43685-7,Divalproex sodium is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders (UCD).,0
1375034,43685-7,"Hyperammonemic encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following initiation of valproate therapy in patients with urea cycle disorders, a group of uncommon genetic abnormalities, particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.",0
1375035,43685-7,"Prior to the initiation of divalproex sodium therapy, evaluation for UCD should be considered in the following patients: 1) those with a history of unexplained encephalopathy or coma, encephalopathy associated with a protein load, pregnancy-related or postpartum encephalopathy, unexplained mental retardation, or history of elevated plasma ammonia or glutamine; 2) those with cyclical vomiting and lethargy, episodic extreme irritability, ataxia, low BUN, or protein avoidance; 3) those with a family history of UCD or a family history of unexplained infant deaths (particularly males); 4) those with other signs or symptoms of UCD.",0
1375036,43685-7,Patients who develop symptoms of unexplained hyperammonemic encephalopathy while receiving valproate therapy should receive prompt treatment (including discontinuation of valproate therapy) and be evaluated for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].,0
1375037,43685-7,5.7 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation,0
1375038,43685-7,"Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including divalproex sodium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication.",0
1375047,43685-7,The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.,0
1375050,43685-7,"Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients /Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9",0
1375052,43685-7,Anyone considering prescribing divalproex sodium or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness.,0
1375057,43685-7,5.8 Thrombocytopenia,0
1375058,43685-7,The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia may be dose-related.,0
1375059,43685-7,"In a clinical trial of valproate as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients (27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets ≤ 75 x 109/L.",0
1375060,43685-7,"Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts to normal.",0
1375061,43685-7,"In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment.",0
1375062,43685-7,"In this study, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg/mL (males).",0
1375063,43685-7,The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse effects.,0
1375064,43685-7,"Because of reports of thrombocytopenia, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation, and abnormal coagulation parameters, (e.g., low fibrinogen), platelet counts and coagulation tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals.",0
1375065,43685-7,It is recommended that patients receiving divalproex sodium be monitored for platelet count and coagulation parameters prior to planned surgery.,0
1375066,43685-7,"Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication for reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy.",0
1375067,43685-7,5.9 Hyperammonemia,0
1375068,43685-7,Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present despite normal liver function tests.,0
1375069,43685-7,"In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.",0
1375070,43685-7,Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with hypothermia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].,0
1375071,43685-7,"If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy should be discontinued.",0
1375072,43685-7,"Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be initiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.10)].",0
1375073,43685-7,"Asymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring of plasma ammonia levels.",0
1375074,43685-7,"If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be considered.",0
1375075,43685-7,5.10 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy Associated with Concomitant Topiramate Use,0
1375076,43685-7,Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone.,0
1375078,43685-7,Hypothermia can also be a manifestation of hyperammonemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].,0
1375081,43685-7,It is not known if topiramate monotherapy is associated with hyperammonemia.,0
1375083,43685-7,"Although not studied, an interaction of topiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons.",0
1375084,43685-7,"In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.9)].",0
1375085,43685-7,5.11 Hypothermia,0
1375086,43685-7,"Hypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to <35°C (95°F), has been reported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of hyperammonemia.",0
1375087,43685-7,This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate with valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].,0
1375088,43685-7,"Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.",0
1375090,43685-7,5.12 Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity Reactions,0
1375091,43685-7,Multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported in close temporal association to the initiation of valproate therapy in adult and pediatric patients (median time to detection 21 days: range 1 to 40 days).,0
1375092,43685-7,"Although there have been a limited number of reports, many of these cases resulted in hospitalization and at least one death has been reported.",0
1375093,43685-7,"Signs and symptoms of this disorder were diverse; however, patients typically, although not exclusively, presented with fever and rash associated with other organ system involvement.",0
1375094,43685-7,"Other associated manifestations may include lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities, hematological abnormalities (e.g., eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), pruritus, nephritis, oliguria, hepato-renal syndrome, arthralgia, and asthenia.",0
1375095,43685-7,"Because the disorder is variable in its expression, other organ system symptoms and signs, not noted here, may occur.",0
1375096,43685-7,"If this reaction is suspected, valproate should be discontinued and an alternative treatment started.",0
1375097,43685-7,"Although the existence of cross sensitivity with other drugs that produce this syndrome is unclear, the experience amongst drugs associated with multi-organ hypersensitivity would indicate this to be a possibility.",0
1375098,43685-7,5.13 Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics,0
1375099,43685-7,"Carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) may reduce serum valproate concentrations to subtherapeutic levels, resulting in loss of seizure control.",0
1375100,43685-7,Serum valproate concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy.,0
1375101,43685-7,Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproate concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].,0
1375102,43685-7,5.14 Somnolence in the Elderly,0
1375103,43685-7,"In a double-blind, multicenter trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia (mean age = 83 years), doses were increased by 125 mg/day to a target dose of 20 mg/kg/day.",0
1375104,43685-7,"A significantly higher proportion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo, and although not statistically significant, there was a higher proportion of patients with dehydration.",0
1375105,43685-7,Discontinuations for somnolence were also significantly higher than with placebo.,0
1375106,43685-7,"In some patients with somnolence (approximately one-half), there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss.",0
1375107,43685-7,"There was a trend for the patients who experienced these events to have a lower baseline albumin concentration, lower valproate clearance, and a higher BUN.",0
1375108,43685-7,"In elderly patients, dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions.",0
1375109,43685-7,Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].,0
1375110,43685-7,5.15 Monitoring: Drug Plasma Concentration,0
1375111,43685-7,"Since valproate may interact with concurrently administered drugs which are capable of enzyme induction, periodic plasma concentration determinations of valproate and concomitant drugs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].",0
1375112,43685-7,5.16 Effect on Ketone and Thyroid Function Tests,0
1375113,43685-7,Valproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a keto-metabolite which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test.,0
1375114,43685-7,There have been reports of altered thyroid function tests associated with valproate.,0
1375115,43685-7,The clinical significance of these is unknown.,0
1375116,43685-7,5.17 Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication,0
1375117,43685-7,There are in vitro studies that suggest valproate stimulates the replication of the HIV and CMV viruses under certain experimental conditions.,0
1375118,43685-7,"The clinical consequence, if any, is not known.",0
1375119,43685-7,"Additionally, the relevance of these in vitro findings is uncertain for patients receiving maximally suppressive antiretroviral therapy.",0
1375120,43685-7,"Nevertheless, these data should be borne in mind when interpreting the results from regular monitoring of the viral load in HIV infected patients receiving valproate or when following CMV infected patients clinically.",0
1375121,43685-7,5.18 Medication Residue in the Stool,0
1375122,43685-7,There have been rare reports of medication residue in the stool.,0
1375123,43685-7,Some patients have had anatomic (including ileostomy or colostomy) or functional gastrointestinal disorders with shortened GI transit times.,0
1375124,43685-7,"In some reports, medication residues have occurred in the context of diarrhea.",0
1375125,43685-7,"It is recommended that plasma valproate levels be checked in patients who experience medication residue in the stool, and patients' clinical condition should be monitored.",0
1375126,43685-7,"If clinically indicated, alternative treatment may be considered.",0
1375896,43685-7,5.1 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle Closure GlaucomaA syndrome consisting of acute myopia associated with secondary angle closure glaucoma has been reported in patients receiving topiramate.,0

1537965,43685-7,5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria,0
1537966,43685-7,Prescribing cephalexin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.,0
1537967,43685-7,Prolonged use of cephalexin may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms.,0
1537968,43685-7,Careful observation of the patient is essential.,0
1537969,43685-7,"If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.",0
1539009,43685-7,5.1 Hyponatremia,0
1539010,43685-7,Clinically significant hyponatremia (sodium <125 mmol/L) can develop during oxcarbazepine use.,0
1539011,43685-7,"In the 14 controlled epilepsy studies 2.5% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients (38/1,524) had a sodium of less than 125 mmol/L at some point during treatment, compared to no such patients assigned placebo or active control (carbamazepine and phenobarbital for adjunctive and monotherapy substitution studies, and phenytoin and valproate for the monotherapy initiation studies).",0
1539012,43685-7,"Clinically significant hyponatremia generally occurred during the first three months of treatment with oxcarbazepine, although there were patients who first developed a serum sodium <125 mmol/L more than one year after initiation of therapy.",0
1539013,43685-7,"Most patients who developed hyponatremia were asymptomatic but patients in the clinical trials were frequently monitored and some had their oxcarbazepine dose reduced, discontinued, or had their fluid intake restricted for hyponatremia.",0
1539014,43685-7,Whether or not these maneuvers prevented the occurrence of more severe events is unknown.,0
1539015,43685-7,Cases of symptomatic hyponatremia have been reported during post-marketing use.,0
1539016,43685-7,"In clinical trials, patients whose treatment with oxcarbazepine was discontinued due to hyponatremia generally experienced normalization of serum sodium within a few days without additional treatment.",0
1539017,43685-7,"Measurement of serum sodium levels should be considered for patients during maintenance treatment with oxcarbazepine, particularly if the patient is receiving other medications known to decrease serum sodium levels (for example, drugs associated with inappropriate ADH secretion) or if symptoms possibly indicating hyponatremia develop (e.g., nausea, malaise, headache, lethargy, confusion, obtundation, or increase in seizure frequency or severity).",0
1539018,43685-7,5.2 Anaphylactic Reactions and Angioedema,0
1539019,43685-7,"Rare cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema involving the larynx, glottis, lips and eyelids have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of oxcarbazepine.",0
1539021,43685-7,"If a patient develops any of these reactions after treatment with oxcarbazepine, the drug should be discontinued and an alternative treatment started.",0
1539022,43685-7,These patients should not be rechallenged with the drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].,0
1539023,43685-7,5.3 Patients with a Past History of Hypersensitivity Reaction to Carbamazepine,0
1539024,43685-7,Patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine should be informed that approximately 25%-30% of them will experience hypersensitivity reactions with oxcarbazepine.,0
1539025,43685-7,"For this reason patients should be specifically questioned about any prior experience with carbamazepine, and patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine should ordinarily be treated with oxcarbazepine only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.",0
1539026,43685-7,"If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop, oxcarbazepine should be discontinued immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.8)].",0
1539028,43685-7,"Serious dermatological reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in both children and adults in association with oxcarbazepine use.",0
1539029,43685-7,"Such serious skin reactions may be life threatening, and some patients have required hospitalization, with very rare reports of fatal outcome.",0
1539030,43685-7,The median time of onset for reported cases was 19 days after treatment initiation.,0
1539031,43685-7,Recurrence of the serious skin reactions following rechallenge with oxcarbazepine has also been reported.,0
1539032,43685-7,"The reporting rate of TEN and SJS associated with oxcarbazepine use, which is generally accepted to be an underestimate due to underreporting, exceeds the background incidence rate estimates by a factor of 3- to 10-fold.",0
1539033,43685-7,Estimates of the background incidence rate for these serious skin reactions in the general population range between 0.5 to 6 cases per million-person years.,0
1539034,43685-7,"Therefore, if a patient develops a skin reaction while taking oxcarbazepine, consideration should be given to discontinuing oxcarbazepine use and prescribing another antiepileptic medication.",0
1539035,43685-7,Association with HLA-B*1502,0
1539036,43685-7,Patients carrying the HLA-B*1502 allele may be at increased risk for SJS/TEN with oxcarbazepine treatment.,0
1539037,43685-7,Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele B*1502 increases the risk for developing SJS/TEN in patients treated with carbamazepine.,0
1539038,43685-7,The chemical structure of oxcarbazepine is similar to that of carbamazepine.,0
1539039,43685-7,"Available clinical evidence, and data from nonclinical studies showing a direct interaction between oxcarbazepine and HLA-B*1502 protein, suggest that the HLA-B*1502 allele may also increase the risk for SJS/TEN with oxcarbazepine.",0
1539040,43685-7,"The frequency of HLA-B*1502 allele ranges from 2 to 12% in Han Chinese populations, is about 8% in Thai populations, and above 15% in the Philippines and in some Malaysian populations.",0
1539041,43685-7,"Allele frequencies up to about 2% and 6% have been reported in Korea and India, respectively.",0
1539042,43685-7,"The frequency of the HLA-B*1502 allele is negligible in people from European descent, several African populations, indigenous peoples of the Americas, Hispanic populations, and in Japanese (< 1%).",0
1539043,43685-7,"Testing for the presence of the HLA-B*1502 allele should be considered in patients with ancestry in genetically at-risk populations, prior to initiating treatment with oxcarbazepine.",0
1539044,43685-7,The use of oxcarbazepine should be avoided in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.,0
1539045,43685-7,"Consideration should also be given to avoid the use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B*1502 positive patients, when alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable.",0
1539046,43685-7,"Screening is not generally recommended in patients from populations in which the prevalence of HLA-B*1502 is low, or in current oxcarbazepine users, as the risk of SJS/TEN is largely confined to the first few months of therapy, regardless of HLA-B*1502 status.",0
1539047,43685-7,The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management.,0
1539048,43685-7,"The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been well characterized.",0
1539050,43685-7,"Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including oxcarbazepine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication.",0

1539089,43685-7,5.6 Withdrawal of AEDs,0
1539090,43685-7,"As with all antiepileptic drugs, oxcarbazepine should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency.",0
1539091,43685-7,5.7 Cognitive/Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events,0
1539092,43685-7,Use of oxcarbazepine has been associated with central nervous system-related adverse events.,0
1539093,43685-7,"The most significant of these can be classified into three general categories: 1) cognitive symptoms including psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration, and speech or language problems, 2) somnolence or fatigue, and 3) coordination abnormalities, including ataxia and gait disturbances.",0
1539095,43685-7,"In one large, fixed-dose study, oxcarbazepine was added to existing AED therapy (up to three concomitant AEDs).",0
1539096,43685-7,"By protocol, the dosage of the concomitant AEDs could not be reduced as oxcarbazepine was added, reduction in oxcarbazepine dosage was not allowed if intolerance developed, and patients were discontinued if unable to tolerate their highest target maintenance doses.",0
1539097,43685-7,"In this trial, 65% of patients were discontinued because they could not tolerate the 2400 mg/day dose of oxcarbazepine on top of existing AEDs.",0
1539098,43685-7,The adverse events seen in this study were primarily CNS related and the risk for discontinuation was dose related.,0
1539099,43685-7,"In this trial, 7.1% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 4% of placebo-treated patients experienced a cognitive adverse event.",0
1539100,43685-7,The risk of discontinuation for these events was about 6.5 times greater on oxcarbazepine than on placebo.,0
1539101,43685-7,"In addition, 26% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 12% of placebo-treated patients experienced somnolence.",0
1539102,43685-7,The risk of discontinuation for somnolence was about 10 times greater on oxcarbazepine than on placebo.,0
1539103,43685-7,"Finally, 28.7% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 6.4% of placebo-treated patients experienced ataxia or gait disturbances.",0
1539104,43685-7,The risk for discontinuation for these events was about seven times greater on oxcarbazepine than on placebo.,0
1539105,43685-7,"In a single placebo-controlled monotherapy trial evaluating 2400 mg/day of oxcarbazepine, no patients in either treatment group discontinued double-blind treatment because of cognitive adverse events, somnolence, ataxia, or gait disturbance.",0
1539106,43685-7,"In the two dose-controlled conversion to monotherapy trials comparing 2400 mg/day and 300 mg/day oxcarbazepine, 1.1% of patients in the 2400 mg/day group discontinued double-blind treatment because of somnolence or cognitive adverse events compared to 0% in the 300 mg/day group.",0
1539107,43685-7,"In these trials, no patients discontinued because of ataxia or gait disturbances in either treatment group.",0
1539109,43685-7,A study was conducted in pediatric patients (3 to 17 years old) with inadequately controlled partial seizures in which oxcarbazepine was added to existing AED therapy (up to two concomitant AEDs).,0
1539110,43685-7,"By protocol, the dosage of concomitant AEDs could not be reduced as oxcarbazepine was added.",0
1539111,43685-7,Oxcarbazepine was titrated to reach a target dose ranging from 30 mg/kg to 46 mg/kg (based on a patient’s body weight with fixed doses for predefined weight ranges).,0
1539112,43685-7,"Cognitive adverse events occurred in 5.8% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients (the single most common event being concentration impairment, 4 of 138 patients) and in 3.1% of patients treated with placebo.",0

1539118,43685-7,"Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has occurred with oxcarbazepine.",0
1539119,43685-7,Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening.,0
1539120,43685-7,"DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection.",0
1539123,43685-7,"It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident.",0
1539125,43685-7,Oxcarbazepine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.,0
1539126,43685-7,"Although there are no case reports to indicate cross sensitivity with other drugs that produce this syndrome, the experience amongst drugs associated with DRESS/multi-organ hypersensitivity would indicate this to be a possibility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].",0

168716,34067-9,The estimated likelihood at the right tail of each curve is less reliable due to small numbers of subjects with high baseline blood pressures.,1
168717,34067-9,"For example, a patient with a blood pressure of 180/105 mmHg has about a 25% likelihood of achieving a goal of less than 140 mmHg (systolic) and 50% likelihood of achieving less than 90 mmHg (diastolic) on irbesartan alone (and lower still likelihoods on HCTZ alone).",1
