11175962,43685-7,Evaluation (consisting of a screening procedure) requires that GABLOFEN be administered into the intrathecal space via a catheter or lumbar puncture [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].,0
11175963,43685-7,"Because of the risks associated with the screening procedure and the adjustment of dosage following pump implantation, these phases must be conducted in a medically supervised and adequately equipped environment following the instructions outlined in the Dosage and Administration section [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 and 2.5)] .",0

11175982,43685-7,"In most cases, symptoms of withdrawal appeared within hours to a few days following interruption of baclofen therapy.",0
11175983,43685-7,"Common reasons for abrupt interruption of intrathecal baclofen therapy included malfunction of the catheter (especially disconnection), low volume in the pump reservoir, and end of pump battery life; human error may have played a causal or contributing role in some cases.",0
11175984,43685-7,"Cases of intrathecal mass at the tip of the implanted catheter leading to withdrawal symptoms have also been reported, most of them involving pharmacy compounded analgesic admixtures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].",0

11175989,43685-7,"Some clinical characteristics of the advanced intrathecal baclofen withdrawal syndrome may resemble autonomic dysreflexia, infection (sepsis), malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic-malignant syndrome, or other conditions associated with a hypermetabolic state or widespread rhabdomyolysis.",0
11175990,43685-7,"Rapid, accurate diagnosis and treatment in an emergency-room or intensive-care setting are important in order to prevent the potentially life-threatening central nervous system and systemic effects of intrathecal baclofen withdrawal.",0
11175991,43685-7,The suggested treatment for intrathecal baclofen withdrawal is the restoration of intrathecal baclofen at or near the same dosage as before therapy was interrupted.,0
11175992,43685-7,"However, if restoration of intrathecal delivery is delayed, treatment with GABA-ergic agonist drugs such as oral or enteral baclofen, or oral, enteral, or intravenous benzodiazepines may prevent potentially fatal sequelae.",0
11175993,43685-7,Oral or enteral baclofen alone should not be relied upon to halt the progression of intrathecal baclofen withdrawal.,0

11175999,43685-7,There were 16 deaths reported among the 576 U.S. patients treated with intrathecal baclofen in pre- and post-marketing studies evaluated as of December 1992.,0
11176000,43685-7,"Because these patients were treated under uncontrolled clinical settings, it is impossible to determine definitively what role, if any, intrathecal baclofen played in their deaths.",0
11176001,43685-7,"As a group, the patients who died were relatively young (mean age was 47 with a range from 25 to 63), but the majority suffered from severe spasticity of many years duration, were nonambulatory, had various medical complications such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and decubiti, and/or had received multiple concomitant medications.",0
11176002,43685-7,"A case-by-case review of the clinical course of the 16 patients who died failed to reveal any unique signs, symptoms, or laboratory results that would suggest that treatment with intrathecal baclofen caused their deaths.",0

11176007,43685-7,An autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion and bilateral pleural effusions.,0
11176008,43685-7,It is impossible to determine whether intrathecal baclofen contributed to these deaths.,0
11176009,43685-7,The third patient underwent three baclofen screening trials.,0
11176010,43685-7,"His medical history included spinal cord injury, aspiration pneumonia, septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, severe metabolic acidosis, hepatic toxicity, and status epilepticus.",0

11176016,43685-7,5.8 Use with Caution in Patients with a History of Autonomic Dysreflexia,0
11176017,43685-7,GABLOFEN should be used with caution in patients with a history of autonomic dysreflexia.,0
11176018,43685-7,The presence of nociceptive stimuli or abrupt withdrawal of GABLOFEN may cause an autonomic dysreflexic episode.,0
11176019,43685-7,5.9 Infections,0
11176020,43685-7,Patients should be infection-free prior to the screening trial with GABLOFEN because the presence of a systemic infection may interfere with an assessment of the patient's response to bolus GABLOFEN.,0
11176021,43685-7,Patients should be infection-free prior to implantation of the pump because the presence of infection may increase the risk of surgical complications.,0
11176022,43685-7,"Moreover, a systemic infection may complicate dosing.",0
11176023,43685-7,5.10 Drowsiness,0

11176029,43685-7,"The most frequent symptoms associated with intrathecal mass are: 1) decreased therapeutic response (worsening spasticity, return of spasticity when previously well controlled, withdrawal symptoms, poor response to escalating doses, or frequent or large dosage increases), 2) pain, 3) neurological deficit/dysfunction.",0
11176030,43685-7,Clinicians should monitor patients on intraspinal therapy carefully for any new neurological signs or symptoms.,0
11176031,43685-7,"In patients with new neurological signs or symptoms suggestive of an intrathecal mass, consider a neurosurgical consultation, since many of the symptoms of inflammatory mass are not unlike the symptoms experienced by patients with severe spasticity from their disease.",0

11620107,43685-7,"Budesonide inhalation suspension, will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone.",0
11620108,43685-7,"Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing budesonide inhalation suspension.",0
11620109,43685-7,"Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with budesonide inhalation suspension should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects.",0
11620110,43685-7,Particular care should be taken in observing patients post-operatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.,0
11620111,43685-7,"It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism, and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when budesonide is administered at higher than recommended doses over prolonged periods of time.",0
