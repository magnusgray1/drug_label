672,42232-9,The possibility of an idiosyncratic reaction in susceptible patients should always be considered (see ADVERSE REACTIONS—General).,0
673,42232-9,"The susceptible population includes patients with a history of a previous reaction to a contrast media, patients with a known sensitivity to iodine per se, and patients with a known clinical hypersensitivity: bronchial asthma, hay fever, and food allergies.",0
674,42232-9,The occurrence of severe idiosyncratic reactions has prompted the use of several pretesting methods.,0
675,42232-9,"However, pretesting cannot be relied upon to predict severe reactions and may itself be hazardous for the patient.",0
676,42232-9,"It is suggested that a thorough medical history with emphasis on allergy and hypersensitivity, prior to the injection of any contrast media, may be more accurate than pretesting in predicting potential adverse reactions.",0
677,42232-9,"A positive history of allergies or hypersensitivity does not arbitrarily contraindicate the use of a contrast agent, where a diagnostic procedure is thought essential, but caution should be exercised (see ADVERSE REACTIONS—General).",0
678,42232-9,Premedication with antihistamines or corticosteroids to avoid or minimize possible allergic reactions in such patients should be considered.,0

7886,34071-1,The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient’s age.,0
7887,34071-1,"The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin.",0
7888,34071-1,"In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function.",0
7889,34071-1,"Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis.",0

7900,34071-1,Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.,0
7901,34071-1,"Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling.",0
7902,34071-1,(See also PRECAUTIONS.),0

7908,34071-1,(See also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS.),0
7940,42232-9,"Monitoring of renal function — Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function.",0
7941,42232-9,"Thus, patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive metformin.",0
7942,42232-9,"In patients with advanced age, metformin should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal function.",0
7943,42232-9,"In elderly patients, particularly those ≥80 years of age, renal function should be monitored regularly and, generally, metformin should not be titrated to the maximum dose (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).",0

7945,42232-9,"In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, renal function should be assessed more frequently and metformin discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present.",0
7946,42232-9,"Use of concomitant medications that may affect renal function or metformin disposition —Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or may interfere with the disposition of metformin, such as cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions), should be used with caution.",0
7947,42232-9,"Radiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials (for example, intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and computed tomography (CT) scans with contrast materials) — Intravascular contrast studies with iodinated materials can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).",0
7948,42232-9,"Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, metformin should be discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal.",0
7949,42232-9,"Hypoxic states — Cardiovascular collapse (shock) from whatever cause, acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia.",0
7950,42232-9,"When such events occur in patients on metformin therapy, the drug should be promptly discontinued.",0
7951,42232-9,Surgical procedures — Metformin therapy should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal.,0
7952,42232-9,Alcohol intake — Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism.,0

7955,42232-9,"Vitamin B12 levels — A decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients receiving metformin in controlled clinical trials of 29 weeks duration.",0
7956,42232-9,"Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation.",0
7957,42232-9,Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on metformin and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests).,0
7958,42232-9,Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels.,0
7959,42232-9,"In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful.",0
7960,42232-9,Change in clinical status of patients with previously controlled type 2 diabetes — A patient with type 2 diabetes previously well controlled on metformin hydrochloride tablets who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague and poorly defined illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis.,0
7961,42232-9,"Evaluation should include serum electrolytes and ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate, pyruvate and metformin levels.",0
7962,42232-9,"If acidosis of either form occurs, metformin must be stopped immediately and other appropriate corrective measures initiated (see also WARNINGS).",0
7963,42232-9,"Hypoglycemia —Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol.",0
7964,42232-9,"Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects.",0

21052,34071-1,Dosage Increases:,0
21053,34071-1,Increases in the dose of theophylline should not be made in response to an acute exacerbation of symptoms of chronic lung disease since theophylline provides little added benefit to inhaled beta2-selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids in this circumstance and increases the risk of adverse effects.,0
21054,34071-1,A peak steady-state serum theophylline concentration should be measured before increasing the dose in response to persistent chronic symptoms to ascertain whether an increase in dose is safe.,0
21055,34071-1,"Before increasing the theophylline dose on the basis of a low serum concentration, the clinician should consider whether the blood sample was obtained at an appropriate time in relationship to the dose and whether the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).",0
21056,34071-1,"As the rate of theophylline clearance may be dose-dependent (i.e., steady-state serum concentrations may increase disproportionately to the increase in dose), an increase in dose based upon a sub-therapeutic serum concentration measurement should be conservative.",0
21057,34071-1,"In general, limiting dose increases to about 25% of the previous total daily dose will reduce the risk of unintended excessive increases in serum theophylline concentration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table VI).",0
21058,42232-9,"Careful consideration of the various interacting drugs and physiologic conditions that can alter theophylline clearance and require dosage adjustment should occur prior to initiation of theophylline therapy, prior to increases in theophylline dose, and during follow up (see WARNINGS).",0

102462,42232-9,Aspirin,0
102463,42232-9,Concomitant administration of oxaprozin and aspirin is not recommended because oxaprozin displaces salicylates from plasma protein binding sites.,0
102464,42232-9,Coadministration would be expected to increase the risk of salicylate toxicity.,0
102465,42232-9,"As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of oxaprozin and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects.",0
102466,42232-9,Methotrexate,0
102467,42232-9,NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices.,0
102468,42232-9,This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate.,0
102469,42232-9,Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.,0
102470,42232-9,Coadministration of oxaprozin with methotrexate results in approximately a 36% reduction in apparent oral clearance of methotrexate.,0
102471,42232-9,A reduction in methotrexate dosage may be considered due to the potential for increased methotrexate toxicity associated with the increased exposure.,0
102472,42232-9,ACE-inhibitors,0
102473,42232-9,Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors.,0
102474,42232-9,Oxaprozin has been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril (significant decrease in dose-adjusted AUC0-24 and Cmax) and its active metabolite enalaprilat (significant increase in dose-adjusted AUC0-24).,0
102475,42232-9,This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.,0
102476,42232-9,Diuretics,0
102477,42232-9,"Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that oxaprozin can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients.",0
102478,42232-9,This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.,0
102479,42232-9,"During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS, Renal effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.",0
102480,42232-9,Lithium,0
102481,42232-9,Oxaprozin like other NSAIDs has produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.,0
102482,42232-9,The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%.,0
102483,42232-9,These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.,0
102484,42232-9,"Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.",0
102485,42232-9,Glyburide,0
102486,42232-9,"While oxaprozin does alter the pharmacokinetics of glyburide, coadministration of oxaprozin to type II non-insulin dependent diabetic patients did not affect the area under the glucose concentration curve nor the magnitude or duration of control.",0
102487,42232-9,"However, it is advisable to monitor patients' blood glucose in the beginning phase of glyburide and oxaprozin cotherapy.",0
102488,42232-9,Warfarin,0
102489,42232-9,"The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than that of users of either drug alone.",0
102490,42232-9,H2-receptor antagonists,0
102491,42232-9,The total body clearance of oxaprozin was reduced by 20% in subjects who concurrently received therapeutic doses of cimetidine or ranitidine; no other pharmacokinetic parameter was affected.,0
102492,42232-9,A change of clearance of this magnitude lies within the range of normal variation and is unlikely to produce a clinically detectable difference in the outcome of therapy.,0
102494,42232-9,Subjects receiving 1200 mg oxaprozin QD with 100 mg metoprolol bid exhibited statistically significant but transient increases in sitting and standing blood pressures after 14 days.,0
102495,42232-9,"Therefore, as with all NSAIDs, routine blood pressure monitoring should be considered in these patients when starting oxaprozin therapy.",0
102496,42232-9,Other drugs,0
102497,42232-9,"The coadministration of oxaprozin and antacids, acetaminophen, or conjugated estrogens resulted in no statistically significant changes in pharmacokinetic parameters in single- and/or multiple-dose studies.",0
102498,42232-9,The interaction of oxaprozin with cardiac glycosides has not been studied.,0
102499,42232-9,False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking oxaprozin.,0
102500,42232-9,This is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests.,0
102501,42232-9,False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of oxaprozin therapy.,0
102502,42232-9,"Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish oxaprozin from benzodiazepines.",0
102503,42232-9,"In oncogenicity studies, oxaprozin administration for 2 years was associated with the exacerbation of liver neoplasms (hepatic adenomas and carcinomas) in male CD mice, but not in female CD mice or rats.",0
102504,42232-9,The significance of this species-specific finding to man is unknown.,0
102505,42232-9,Oxaprozin did not display mutagenic potential.,0
102506,42232-9,"Results from the Ames test, forward mutation in yeast and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, DNA repair testing in CHO cells, micronucleus testing in mouse bone marrow, chromosomal aberration testing in human lymphocytes, and cell transformation testing in mouse fibroblast all showed no evidence of genetic toxicity or cell-transforming ability.",0
102507,42232-9,Oxaprozin administration was not associated with impairment of fertility in male and female rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (1180 mg/m2); the usual human dose is 17 mg/kg/day (629 mg/m2).,0
102508,42232-9,"However, testicular degeneration was observed in beagle dogs treated with 37.5 to 150 mg/kg/day (750 to 3000 mg/m2) of oxaprozin for 6 months, or 37.5 mg/kg/day for 42 days, a finding not confirmed in other species.",0
102509,42232-9,The clinical relevance of this finding is not known.,0
102510,42232-9,"Teratology studies with oxaprozin were performed in mice, rats, and rabbits.",0
102511,42232-9,"In mice and rats, no drug-related developmental abnormalities were observed at 50 to 200 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin (225 to 900 mg/m2).",0
102512,42232-9,"However, in rabbits, infrequent malformed fetuses were observed in dams treated with 7.5 to 30 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin (the usual human dosage range).",0
102513,42232-9,Animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response.,0
102514,42232-9,There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women.,0
102515,42232-9,Oxaprozin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus.,0
102516,42232-9,"Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.",0
102517,42232-9,"In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred.",0
102518,42232-9,The effects of oxaprozin on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.,0
102519,42232-9,"It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk; however, oxaprozin was found in the milk of lactating rats.",0
102520,42232-9,"Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from oxaprozin, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",0
102521,42232-9,Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years of age have not been established.,0
102522,42232-9,"The effectiveness of oxaprozin for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) in pediatric patients aged 6-16 years is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, and is based on an extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of oxaprozin in adults with rheumatoid arthritis and the similarity in the course of the disease and the drug's mechanism of effect between these two patient populations.",0
102523,42232-9,Use of oxaprozin in JRA patients 6-16 years of age is also supported by the following pediatric studies.,0
102524,42232-9,The pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability of oxaprozin were assessed in JRA patients relative to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients in a 14 day multiple dose pharmacokinetic study.,0
102525,42232-9,"Apparent clearance of unbound oxaprozin in JRA patients was reduced compared to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, but this reduction could be accounted for by differences in body weight (see Pharmacokinetics, Pediatric patients).",0
102526,42232-9,No pharmacokinetic data are available for pediatric patients under 6 years.,0
102527,42232-9,Adverse events were reported by approximately 45% of JRA patients versus an approximate 30% incidence of adverse events in the adult rheumatoid arthritis patient cohort.,0
102528,42232-9,Most of the adverse events were related to the gastrointestinal tract and were mild to moderate.,0
102529,42232-9,"In a 3 month open label study, 10-20 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin were administered to 59 JRA patients.",0
102530,42232-9,Adverse events were reported by 58% of JRA patients.,0
102531,42232-9,"Most of those reported were generally mild to moderate, tolerated by the patients, and did not interfere with continuing treatment.",0
102532,42232-9,Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most frequently reported adverse effects and occurred at a higher incidence than those historically seen in controlled studies in adults.,0
102533,42232-9,Fifty-two patients completed 3 months of treatment with a mean daily dose of 20 mg/kg.,0
102534,42232-9,"Of 30 patients who continued treatment (19-48 week range total treatment duration), nine (30%) experienced rash on sun-exposed areas of the skin and 5 of those discontinued treatment.",0
102535,42232-9,Controlled clinical trials with oxaprozin in pediatric patients have not been conducted.,0
102536,42232-9,"No adjustment of the dose of oxaprozin is necessary in the elderly for pharmacokinetic reasons, although many elderly may need to receive a reduced dose because of low body weight or disorders associated with aging.",0
102537,42232-9,"No significant differences in the pharmacokinetic profile for oxaprozin were seen in studies in the healthy elderly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special populations).",0
102538,42232-9,"Of the total number of subjects evaluated in four placebo controlled clinical studies of oxaprozin, 39% were 65 and over, and 11 % were 75 and over.",0
102540,42232-9,"Although selected elderly patients in controlled clinical trials tolerated as well as younger patients, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly, and extra care should be taken when choosing a dose.",0
102541,42232-9,"As with any NSAID, the elderly are likely to tolerate adverse reactions less well than younger patients.",0
102542,42232-9,"Oxaprozin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to oxaprozin may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.",0
102543,42232-9,"Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see WARNINGS, Renal effects).",0

106105,42232-9,Therapy with medications that are predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that have a relatively narrow therapeutic index (see list below) should be initiated at the low end of the dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine concurrently or has taken it in the previous 5 weeks.,0
106106,42232-9,"Thus, his/her dosing requirements resemble those of poor metabolizers.",0
106107,42232-9,"If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need for decreased dose of the original medication should be considered.",0
106108,42232-9,"Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index represent the greatest concern (e.g., flecainide, propafenone, vinblastine, and TCAs).",0
106109,42232-9,"Due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).",0
106110,42232-9,"Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 — In an in vivo interaction study involving coadministration of fluoxetine with single doses of terfenadine (a CYP3A4 substrate), no increase in plasma terfenadine concentrations occurred with concomitant fluoxetine.",0

106112,42232-9,These data indicate that fluoxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.,0
106113,42232-9,CNS active drugs — The risk of using Prozac in combination with other CNS active drugs has not been systematically evaluated.,0
106114,42232-9,"Nonetheless, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of Prozac and such drugs is required.",0
106115,42232-9,"In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status (see Accumulation and slow elimination under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).",0
106116,42232-9,Anticonvulsants — Patients on stable doses of phenytoin and carbamazepine have developed elevated plasma anticonvulsant concentrations and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity following initiation of concomitant fluoxetine treatment.,0
106117,42232-9,Antipsychotics — Some clinical data suggests a possible pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic interaction between SSRIs and antipsychotics.,0
106118,42232-9,Elevation of blood levels of haloperidol and clozapine has been observed in patients receiving concomitant fluoxetine.,0
106119,42232-9,Clinical studies of pimozide with other antidepressants demonstrate an increase in drug interaction or QTc prolongation.,0
106120,42232-9,"While a specific study with pimozide and fluoxetine has not been conducted, the potential for drug interactions or QTc prolongation warrants restricting the concurrent use of pimozide and Prozac.",0
106121,42232-9,Concomitant use of Prozac and pimozide is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).,0
106122,42232-9,"For thioridazine, see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.",0
106123,42232-9,Benzodiazepines — The half–life of concurrently administered diazepam may be prolonged in some patients (see Accumulation and slow elimination under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).,0
106124,42232-9,Coadministration of alprazolam and fluoxetine has resulted in increased alprazolam plasma concentrations and in further psychomotor performance decrement due to increased alprazolam levels.,0
106125,42232-9,Lithium — There have been reports of both increased and decreased lithium levels when lithium was used concomitantly with fluoxetine.,0
106126,42232-9,Cases of lithium toxicity and increased serotonergic effects have been reported.,0
106127,42232-9,Lithium levels should be monitored when these drugs are administered concomitantly.,0

106129,42232-9,Monoamine oxidase inhibitors — See CONTRAINDICATIONS.,0
106130,42232-9,"Other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder — In 2 studies, previously stable plasma levels of imipramine and desipramine have increased greater than 2– to 10–fold when fluoxetine has been administered in combination.",0
106131,42232-9,This influence may persist for 3 weeks or longer after fluoxetine is discontinued.,0
106132,42232-9,"Thus, the dose of TCA may need to be reduced and plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored temporarily when fluoxetine is coadministered or has been recently discontinued (see Accumulation and slow elimination under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, and Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 under Drug Interactions).",0
106133,42232-9,"Serotonergic drugs — Based on the mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs, including Prozac, and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when Prozac is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non–selective MAOI), lithium, tramadol, or St. John’s Wort (see Serotonin Syndrome under WARNINGS).",0
106134,42232-9,"The concomitant use of Prozac with other SSRIs, SNRIs or tryptophan is not recommended (see Tryptophan).",0

106136,42232-9,"If concomitant treatment of Prozac with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see Serotonin Syndrome under WARNINGS).",0
106137,42232-9,"Potential effects of coadministration of drugs tightly bound to plasma proteins — Because fluoxetine is tightly bound to plasma protein, the administration of fluoxetine to a patient taking another drug that is tightly bound to protein (e.g., Coumadin, digitoxin) may cause a shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse effect.",0
106138,42232-9,"Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein–bound fluoxetine by other tightly–bound drugs (see Accumulation and slow elimination under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).",0
106139,42232-9,"Drugs that interfere with hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin) — Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis.",0
106140,42232-9,Epidemiological studies of the case–control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding.,0
106141,42232-9,"Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin.",0
106142,42232-9,Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when fluoxetine is initiated or discontinued.,0
106143,42232-9,Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) — There are no clinical studies establishing the benefit of the combined use of ECT and fluoxetine.,0
106144,42232-9,There have been rare reports of prolonged seizures in patients on fluoxetine receiving ECT treatment.,0
106145,42232-9,There is no evidence of carcinogenicity or mutagenicity from in vitro or animal studies.,0
106146,42232-9,Impairment of fertility in adult animals at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) was not observed.,0
106147,42232-9,"Carcinogenicity — The dietary administration of fluoxetine to rats and mice for 2 years at doses of up to 10 and 12 mg/kg/day, respectively [approximately 1.2 and 0.7 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg on a mg/m2 basis], produced no evidence of carcinogenicity.",0
106148,42232-9,"Mutagenicity — Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine have been shown to have no genotoxic effects based on the following assays: bacterial mutation assay, DNA repair assay in cultured rat hepatocytes, mouse lymphoma assay, and in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay in Chinese hamster bone marrow cells.",0
106149,42232-9,Impairment of fertility — Two fertility studies conducted in adult rats at doses of up to 7.5 and 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.9 and 1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) indicated that fluoxetine had no adverse effects on fertility (see Pediatric Use).,0
106150,42232-9,"In embryo–fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, there was no evidence of teratogenicity following administration of up to 12.5 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (1.5 and 3.6 times, respectively, the MRHD of 80 mg on a mg/m2 basis) throughout organogenesis.",0
106151,42232-9,"However, in rat reproduction studies, an increase in stillborn pups, a decrease in pup weight, and an increase in pup deaths during the first 7 days postpartum occurred following maternal exposure to 12 mg/kg/day (1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) during gestation or 7.5 mg/kg/day (0.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) during gestation and lactation.",0
106152,42232-9,There was no evidence of developmental neurotoxicity in the surviving offspring of rats treated with 12 mg/kg/day during gestation.,0
106153,42232-9,The no–effect dose for rat pup mortality was 5 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).,0
106154,42232-9,Prozac should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.,0
106155,42232-9,"Neonates exposed to Prozac and other SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding.",0
106156,42232-9,Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery.,0
106157,42232-9,"Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying.",0
106158,42232-9,"These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome.",0
106159,42232-9,"It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see Monoamine oxidase inhibitors under CONTRAINDICATIONS).",0
106160,42232-9,Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).,0
106161,42232-9,PPHN occurs in 1–2 per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.,0
106162,42232-9,"In a retrospective case–control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six–fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy.",0
106163,42232-9,There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk.,0
106164,42232-9,The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk.,0
106165,42232-9,"When treating a pregnant woman with Prozac during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).",0
106166,42232-9,"Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication.",0
106167,42232-9,The effect of Prozac on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.,0
106168,42232-9,"However, because fluoxetine crosses the placenta and because of the possibility that fluoxetine may have adverse effects on the newborn, fluoxetine should be used during labor and delivery only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.",0

111091,34071-1,Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events—Pediatric Patients 3-12 Years Of Age,0
111092,34071-1,Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3–12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events.,0
111093,34071-1,"The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity).",0
111094,34071-1,"Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity.",0
111095,34071-1,In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3–12 years of age the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%.,0
111096,34071-1,"One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious.",0
111097,34071-1,Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder.,0

111099,34071-1,"Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus",0
111100,34071-1,"Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency.In the placebo-controlled studies in patients greater than 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378).",0
111101,34071-1,Among the 2074 patients greater than 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus.,0
111102,34071-1,"Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications.",0
111103,34071-1,"Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin.",0
111104,34071-1,"Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats.",0
111105,34071-1,"(See PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility.)",0
111106,34071-1,The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.,0
111107,34071-1,Clinical experience during gabapentin’s premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans.,0
111108,34071-1,"In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients greater than 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin.",0
111109,34071-1,"Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment.",0
111110,34071-1,Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy,0
111111,34071-1,During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure).,0
111112,34071-1,"Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night.",0
111113,34071-1,This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year.,0
111114,34071-1,"Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy).",0
111115,34071-1,"Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided.",0
111117,42232-9,Patients should be instructed to take gabapentin only as prescribed.,0
111118,42232-9,"Patients should be advised that gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence and other symptoms and signs of CNS depression.",0
111119,42232-9,"Accordingly, they should be advised neither to drive a car nor to operate other complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on gabapentin to gauge whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely.",0
111120,42232-9,Patients who require concomitant treatment with morphine may experience increases in gabapentin concentrations.,0
111121,42232-9,"Patients should be carefully observed for signs of CNS depression, such as somnolence, and the dose of gabapentin or morphine should be reduced appropriately (see Drug Interactions).",0
111123,42232-9,Clinical trials data do not indicate that routine monitoring of clinical laboratory parameters is necessary for the safe use of gabapentin.,0
111124,42232-9,The value of monitoring gabapentin blood concentrations has not been established.,0
111125,42232-9,Gabapentin may be used in combination with other antiepileptic drugs without concern for alteration of the blood concentrations of gabapentin or of other antiepileptic drugs.,0
111127,42232-9,"In vitro studies were conducted to investigate the potential of gabapentin to inhibit the major cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4) that mediate drug and xenobiotic metabolism using isoform selective marker substrates and human liver microsomal preparations.",0
111128,42232-9,Only at the highest concentration tested (171 mcg/mL; 1 mM) was a slight degree of inhibition (14%-30%) of isoform CYP2A6 observed.,0
111129,42232-9,No inhibition of any of the other isoforms tested was observed at gabapentin concentrations up to 171 mcg/mL (approximately 15 times the Cmax at 3600 mg/day).,0
111130,42232-9,Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized nor does it interfere with the metabolism of commonly coadministered antiepileptic drugs.,0
111131,42232-9,The drug interaction data described in this section were obtained from studies involving healthy adults and adult patients with epilepsy.,0
111132,42232-9,"Phenytoin: In a single (400 mg) and multiple dose (400 mg TID) study of gabapentin in epileptic patients (N=8) maintained on phenytoin monotherapy for at least 2 months, gabapentin had no effect on the steady-state trough plasma concentrations of phenytoin and phenytoin had no effect on gabapentin pharmacokinetics.",0
111133,42232-9,"Carbamazepine: Steady-state trough plasma carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10, 11 epoxide concentrations were not affected by concomitant gabapentin (400 mg TID; N=12) administration.",0
111134,42232-9,"Likewise, gabapentin pharmacokinetics were unaltered by carbamazepine administration.",0
111135,42232-9,Valproic Acid: The mean steady-state trough serum valproic acid concentrations prior to and during concomitant gabapentin administration (400 mg TID; N=17) were not different and neither were gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters affected by valproic acid.,0
111136,42232-9,Phenobarbital: Estimates of steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for phenobarbital or gabapentin (300 mg TID; N=12) are identical whether the drugs are administered alone or together.,0
111137,42232-9,Naproxen: Coadministration (N=18) of naproxen sodium capsules (250 mg) with gabapentin (125 mg) appears to increase the amount of gabapentin absorbed by 12% to 15%.,0
111138,42232-9,Gabapentin had no effect on naproxen pharmacokinetic parameters.,0
111139,42232-9,These doses are lower than the therapeutic doses for both drugs.,0
111140,42232-9,The magnitude of interaction within the recommended dose ranges of either drug is not known.,0
111141,42232-9,"Hydrocodone: Coadministration of gabapentin (125 to 500 mg; N=48) decreases hydrocodone (10 mg; N=50) Cmax and AUC values in a dose-dependent manner relative to administration of hydrocodone alone; Cmax and AUC values are 3% to 4% lower, respectively, after administration of 125 mg gabapentin and 21% to 22% lower, respectively, after administration of 500 mg gabapentin.",0
111142,42232-9,The mechanism for this interaction is unknown.,0
111143,42232-9,Hydrocodone increases gabapentin AUC values by 14%.,0
111144,42232-9,The magnitude of interaction at other doses is not known.,0
111145,42232-9,"Morphine: A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release morphine capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg gabapentin capsule (N=12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine (see PRECAUTIONS).",0
111146,42232-9,Morphine pharmacokinetic parameter values were not affected by administration of gabapentin 2 hours after morphine.,0
111148,42232-9,Cimetidine: In the presence of cimetidine at 300 mg QID (N=12) the mean apparent oral clearance of gabapentin fell by 14% and creatinine clearance fell by 10%.,0
111149,42232-9,"Thus cimetidine appeared to alter the renal excretion of both gabapentin and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function.",0
111150,42232-9,This small decrease in excretion of gabapentin by cimetidine is not expected to be of clinical importance.,0
111151,42232-9,The effect of gabapentin on cimetidine was not evaluated.,0
111152,42232-9,"Oral Contraceptive: Based on AUC and half-life, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of tablets containing 2.5 mg of norethindrone acetate and 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol were similar with and without coadministration of gabapentin (400 mg TID; N=13).",0
111153,42232-9,The Cmax of norethindrone was 13% higher when it was coadministered with gabapentin; this interaction is not expected to be of clinical importance.,0
111154,42232-9,Antacid (Maalox®*): Maalox reduced the bioavailability of gabapentin (N=16) by about 20%.,0
111155,42232-9,This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when gabapentin was administered 2 hours after Maalox.,0
111156,42232-9,It is recommended that gabapentin be taken at least 2 hours following Maalox administration.,0
111157,42232-9,Effect of Probenecid: Probenecid is a blocker of renal tubular secretion.,0
111158,42232-9,Gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters without and with probenecid were comparable.,0
111159,42232-9,This indicates that gabapentin does not undergo renal tubular secretion by the pathway that is blocked by probenecid.,0
111160,42232-9,Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions,0
111161,42232-9,"Because false positive readings were reported with the Ames N-Multistix SG® dipstick test for urinary protein when gabapentin was added to other antiepileptic drugs, the more specific sulfosalicylic acid precipitation procedure is recommended to determine the presence of urine protein.",0
111163,42232-9,"Gabapentin was given in the diet to mice at 200, 600, and 2000 mg/kg/day and to rats at 250, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg/day for 2 years.",0
111164,42232-9,A statistically significant increase in the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell adenomas and carcinomas was found in male rats receiving the high dose; the no-effect dose for the occurrence of carcinomas was 1000 mg/kg/day.,0
111165,42232-9,"Peak plasma concentrations of gabapentin in rats receiving the high dose of 2000 mg/kg were 10 times higher than plasma concentrations in humans receiving 3600 mg per day, and in rats receiving 1000 mg/kg/day peak plasma concentrations were 6.5 times higher than in humans receiving 3600 mg/day.",0
111166,42232-9,"The pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas did not affect survival, did not metastasize and were not locally invasive.",0
111167,42232-9,The relevance of this finding to carcinogenic risk in humans is unclear.,0
111168,42232-9,"Studies designed to investigate the mechanism of gabapentin-induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in rats indicate that gabapentin stimulates DNA synthesis in rat pancreatic acinar cells in vitro and, thus, may be acting as a tumor promoter by enhancing mitogenic activity.",0
111169,42232-9,"It is not known whether gabapentin has the ability to increase cell proliferation in other cell types or in other species, including humans.",0
111170,42232-9,Gabapentin did not demonstrate mutagenic or genotoxic potential in three in vitro and four in vivo assays.,0
111171,42232-9,It was negative in the Ames test and the in vitro HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells; it did not produce significant increases in chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay; it was negative in the in vivo chromosomal aberration assay and in the in vivo micronucleus test in Chinese hamster bone marrow; it was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay; and it did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in hepatocytes from rats given gabapentin.,0
111172,42232-9,No adverse effects on fertility or reproduction were observed in rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (approximately 5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis).,0
111174,42232-9,"Pregnancy Category C: Gabapentin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rodents, causing delayed ossification of several bones in the skull, vertebrae, forelimbs, and hindlimbs.",0
111175,42232-9,"These effects occurred when pregnant mice received oral doses of 1000 or 3000 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis, or approximately 1 to 4 times the maximum dose of 3600 mg/day given to epileptic patients on a mg/m2 basis.",0
111176,42232-9,The no-effect level was 500 mg/kg/day or approximately ½ of the human dose on a mg/m2 basis.,0
111177,42232-9,"When rats were dosed prior to and during mating, and throughout gestation, pups from all dose groups (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day) were affected.",0
111178,42232-9,These doses are equivalent to less than approximately 1 to 5 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m2 basis.,0
111179,42232-9,"There was an increased incidence of hydroureter and/or hydronephrosis in rats in a study of fertility and general reproductive performance at 2000 mg/kg/day with no effect at 1000 mg/kg/day, in a teratology study at 1500 mg/kg/day with no effect at 300 mg/kg/day, and in a perinatal and postnatal study at all doses studied (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day).",0
111180,42232-9,The doses at which the effects occurred are approximately 1 to 5 times the maximum human dose of 3600 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis; the no-effect doses were approximately 3 times (Fertility and General Reproductive Performance study) and approximately equal to (Teratogenicity study) the maximum human dose on a mg/m2 basis.,0
111181,42232-9,"Other than hydroureter and hydronephrosis, the etiologies of which are unclear, the incidence of malformations was not increased compared to controls in offspring of mice, rats, or rabbits given doses up to 50 times (mice), 30 times (rats), and 25 times (rabbits) the human daily dose on a mg/kg basis, or 4 times (mice), 5 times (rats), or 8 times (rabbits) the human daily dose on a mg/m2 basis.",0
111182,42232-9,"In a teratology study in rabbits, an increased incidence of postimplantation fetal loss occurred in dams exposed to 60, 300, and 1500 mg/kg/day, or less than approximately ¼ to 8 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m2 basis.",0
111184,42232-9,This drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.,0
111185,42232-9,Use in Nursing Mothers,0
111186,42232-9,Gabapentin is secreted into human milk following oral administration.,0
111187,42232-9,A nursed infant could be exposed to a maximum dose of approximately 1 mg/kg/day of gabapentin.,0
111188,42232-9,"Because the effect on the nursing infant is unknown, gabapentin should be used in women who are nursing only if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.",0
111190,42232-9,Safety and effectiveness of gabapentin in the management of postherpetic neuralgia in pediatric patients have not been established.,0
111191,42232-9,"Effectiveness as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years has not been established (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies).",0
111193,42232-9,"The total number of patients treated with gabapentin in controlled clinical trials in patients with postherpetic neuralgia was 336, of which 102 (30%) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 168 (50%) were 75 years of age and older.",0
111194,42232-9,There was a larger treatment effect in patients 75 years of age and older compared with younger patients who received the same dosage.,0
111195,42232-9,"Since gabapentin is almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion, the larger treatment effect observed in patients ≥75 years may be a consequence of increased gabapentin exposure for a given dose that results from an age-related decrease in renal function.",0
111196,42232-9,"However, other factors cannot be excluded.",0
111197,42232-9,"The types and incidence of adverse events were similar across age groups except for peripheral edema and ataxia, which tended to increase in incidence with age.",0
111198,42232-9,Clinical studies of gabapentin in epilepsy did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects.,0
111202,42232-9,"Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and dose should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values in these patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, ADVERSE REACTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections).",0

119176,34071-1,The effect of NEUPOGEN® on the development of abnormal cytogenetics and the effect of continued NEUPOGEN® administration in patients with abnormal cytogenetics or MDS are unknown.,0
119177,34071-1,If a patient with SCN develops abnormal cytogenetics or myelodysplasia‚ the risks and benefits of continuing NEUPOGEN® should be carefully considered.,0
119180,42232-9,Simultaneous Use With Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy,0
119181,42232-9,The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN® given simultaneously with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been established.,0
119182,42232-9,Because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy‚ do not use NEUPOGEN® in the period 24 hours before through 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).,0
119183,42232-9,"The efficacy of NEUPOGEN® has not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy associated with delayed myelosuppression (eg, nitrosoureas) or with mitomycin C or with myelosuppressive doses of antimetabolites such as 5-fluorouracil.",0
119184,42232-9,The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN® have not been evaluated in patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy.,0
119185,42232-9,Simultaneous use of NEUPOGEN® with chemotherapy and radiation therapy should be avoided.,0
119186,42232-9,Potential Effect on Malignant Cells,0
119187,42232-9,NEUPOGEN® is a growth factor that primarily stimulates neutrophils.,0
119188,42232-9,However‚ the possibility that NEUPOGEN® can act as a growth factor for any tumor type cannot be excluded.,0
119189,42232-9,"In a randomized study evaluating the effects of NEUPOGEN® versus placebo in patients undergoing remission induction for AML, there was no significant difference in remission rate, disease-free, or overall survival (see CLINICAL EXPERIENCE ).",0
119190,42232-9,The safety of NEUPOGEN® in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplasia has not been established.,0
119191,42232-9,When NEUPOGEN® is used to mobilize PBPC‚ tumor cells may be released from the marrow and subsequently collected in the leukapheresis product.,0
119192,42232-9,The effect of reinfusion of tumor cells has not been well studied‚ and the limited data available are inconclusive.,0
119193,42232-9,Leukocytosis,0
119194,42232-9,Cancer Patients Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy,0
119195,42232-9,White blood cell counts of 100‚000/mm3 or greater were observed in approximately 2% of patients receiving NEUPOGEN® at doses above 5 mcg/kg/day.,0
119196,42232-9,There were no reports of adverse events associated with this degree of leukocytosis.,0
119197,42232-9,In order to avoid the potential complications of excessive leukocytosis‚ a CBC is recommended twice per week during NEUPOGEN® therapy (see LABORATORY MONITORING ).,0
119198,42232-9,Premature Discontinuation of NEUPOGEN® Therapy,0
119199,42232-9,A transient increase in neutrophil counts is typically seen 1 to 2 days after initiation of NEUPOGEN® therapy.,0
119200,42232-9,However‚ for a sustained therapeutic response‚ NEUPOGEN® therapy should be continued following chemotherapy until the post nadir ANC reaches 10‚000/mm3.,0
119201,42232-9,Therefore‚ the premature discontinuation of NEUPOGEN® therapy‚ prior to the time of recovery from the expected neutrophil nadir‚ is generally not recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).,0
119202,42232-9,Immunogenicity,0
119203,42232-9,"As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.",0
119204,42232-9,The incidence of antibody development in patients receiving NEUPOGEN® has not been adequately determined.,0
119205,42232-9,"While available data suggest that a small proportion of patients developed binding antibodies to Filgrastim, the nature and specificity of these antibodies has not been adequately studied.",0
119206,42232-9,"In clinical studies comparing NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta®, the incidence of antibodies binding to NEUPOGEN® was 3% (11/333).",0
119207,42232-9,"In these 11 patients, no evidence of a neutralizing response was observed using a cell-based bioassay.",0
119208,42232-9,"The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, and the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including timing of sampling, sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.",0
119209,42232-9,"Therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to NEUPOGEN® with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.",0
119210,42232-9,Cytopenias resulting from an antibody response to exogenous growth factors have been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with other recombinant growth factors.,0
119211,42232-9,"There is a theoretical possibility that an antibody directed against Filgrastim may cross-react with endogenous G-CSF, resulting in immune-mediated neutropenia; however, this has not been reported in clinical studies or in post-marketing experience.",0
119212,42232-9,Patients who develop hypersensitivity to Filgrastim (NEUPOGEN®) may have allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to other E coli-derived proteins.,0
119213,42232-9,Cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with NEUPOGEN®.,0
119214,42232-9,In most cases‚ the severity of cutaneous vasculitis was moderate or severe.,0
119215,42232-9,Most of the reports involved patients with SCN receiving long-term NEUPOGEN® therapy.,0
119216,42232-9,Symptoms of vasculitis generally developed simultaneously with an increase in the ANC and abated when the ANC decreased.,0
119217,42232-9,Many patients were able to continue NEUPOGEN® at a reduced dose.,0
119218,42232-9,Information for Patients and Caregivers,0
119219,42232-9,Patients should be referred to the “Information for Patients and Caregivers” labeling included with the package insert in each dispensing pack of NEUPOGEN® vials or NEUPOGEN® prefilled syringes.,0
119220,42232-9,The “Information for Patients and Caregivers” labeling provides information about neutrophils and neutropenia and the safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN®.,0
119221,42232-9,It is not intended to be a disclosure of all known or possible effects.,0
119222,42232-9,Laboratory Monitoring,0
119223,42232-9,A CBC and platelet count should be obtained prior to chemotherapy‚ and at regular intervals (twice per week) during NEUPOGEN® therapy.,0
119224,42232-9,Following cytotoxic chemotherapy‚ the neutrophil nadir occurred earlier during cycles when NEUPOGEN® was administered‚ and WBC differentials demonstrated a left shift‚ including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts.,0
119225,42232-9,In addition‚ the duration of severe neutropenia was reduced‚ and was followed by an accelerated recovery in the neutrophil counts.,0
119226,42232-9,Cancer Patients Receiving Bone Marrow Transplant,0
119227,42232-9,Frequent CBCs and platelet counts are recommended (at least 3 times per week) following marrow transplantation.,0
119228,42232-9,Patients With Severe Chronic Neutropenia,0
119229,42232-9,During the initial 4 weeks of NEUPOGEN® therapy and during the 2 weeks following any dose adjustment‚ a CBC with differential and platelet count should be performed twice weekly.,0
119230,42232-9,Once a patient is clinically stable‚ a CBC with differential and platelet count should be performed monthly during the first year of treatment.,0
119231,42232-9,"Thereafter, if clinically stable, routine monitoring with regular CBCs (ie, as clinically indicated but at least quarterly) is recommended.",0
119232,42232-9,"Additionally, for those patients with congenital neutropenia, annual bone marrow and cytogenetic evaluations should be performed throughout the duration of treatment (see WARNINGS , ADVERSE REACTIONS ).",0
119233,42232-9,In clinical trials‚ the following laboratory results were observed:,0
119234,42232-9,Cyclic fluctuations in the neutrophil counts were frequently observed in patients with congenital or idiopathic neutropenia after initiation of NEUPOGEN® therapy.,0
119235,42232-9,Platelet counts were generally at the upper limits of normal prior to NEUPOGEN® therapy.,0
119236,42232-9,With NEUPOGEN® therapy‚ platelet counts decreased but usually remained within normal limits (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ).,0
119237,42232-9,Early myeloid forms were noted in peripheral blood in most patients‚ including the appearance of metamyelocytes and myelocytes.,0
119238,42232-9,Promyelocytes and myeloblasts were noted in some patients.,0
119239,42232-9,Relative increases were occasionally noted in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils.,0
119240,42232-9,No consistent increases were observed with NEUPOGEN® therapy.,0
119241,42232-9,As in other trials‚ increases were observed in serum uric acid‚ lactic dehydrogenase‚ and serum alkaline phosphatase.,0
119242,42232-9,Drug Interaction,0
119243,42232-9,Drug interactions between NEUPOGEN® and other drugs have not been fully evaluated.,0
119244,42232-9,Drugs which may potentiate the release of neutrophils‚ such as lithium‚ should be used with caution.,0
119245,42232-9,Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone imaging changes.,0
119246,42232-9,This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results.,0
119248,42232-9,The carcinogenic potential of NEUPOGEN® has not been studied.,0
119249,42232-9,NEUPOGEN® failed to induce bacterial gene mutations in either the presence or absence of a drug metabolizing enzyme system.,0
119250,42232-9,NEUPOGEN® had no observed effect on the fertility of male or female rats‚ or on gestation at doses up to 500 mcg/kg.,0
119251,42232-9,Pregnancy Category C,0
119252,42232-9,NEUPOGEN® has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits when given in doses 2 to 10 times the human dose.,0
119253,42232-9,"Since there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, the effect, if any, of NEUPOGEN® on the developing fetus or the reproductive capacity of the mother is unknown.",0
119254,42232-9,"However, the scientific literature describes transplacental passage of NEUPOGEN® when administered to pregnant rats during the latter part of gestation18 and apparent transplacental passage of NEUPOGEN® when administered to pregnant humans by ≤ 30 hours prior to preterm delivery (≤ 30 weeks gestation).19 NEUPOGEN® should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.",0
119255,42232-9,In rabbits‚ increased abortion and embryolethality were observed in animals treated with NEUPOGEN® at 80 mcg/kg/day.,0
119256,42232-9,NEUPOGEN® administered to pregnant rabbits at doses of 80 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis was associated with increased fetal resorption‚ genitourinary bleeding‚ developmental abnormalities‚ decreased body weight‚ live births‚ and food consumption.,0
119257,42232-9,External abnormalities were not observed in the fetuses of dams treated at 80 mcg/kg/day.,0
119258,42232-9,Reproductive studies in pregnant rats have shown that NEUPOGEN® was not associated with lethal‚ teratogenic‚ or behavioral effects on fetuses when administered by daily IV injection during the period of organogenesis at dose levels up to 575 mcg/kg/day.,0
119259,42232-9,In Segment III studies in rats‚ offspring of dams treated at > 20 mcg/kg/day exhibited a delay in external differentiation (detachment of auricles and descent of testes) and slight growth retardation‚ possibly due to lower body weight of females during rearing and nursing.,0
119260,42232-9,Offspring of dams treated at 100 mcg/kg/day exhibited decreased body weights at birth‚ and a slightly reduced 4-day survival rate.,0
119262,42232-9,It is not known whether NEUPOGEN® is excreted in human milk.,0
119263,42232-9,Because many drugs are excreted in human milk‚ caution should be exercised if NEUPOGEN® is administered to a nursing woman.,0
119265,42232-9,"In a phase 3 study to assess the safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN® in the treatment of SCN, 120 patients with a median age of 12 years were studied.",0
119266,42232-9,"Of the 120 patients, 12 were infants (1 month to 2 years of age), 47 were children (2 to 12 years of age), and 9 were adolescents (12 to 16 years of age).",0
119267,42232-9,"Additional information is available from a SCN postmarketing surveillance study, which includes long-term follow-up of patients in the clinical studies and information from additional patients who entered directly into the postmarketing surveillance study.",0
119268,42232-9,"Of the 531 patients in the surveillance study as of 31 December 1997, 32 were infants, 200 were children, and 68 were adolescents (see CLINICAL EXPERIENCE , INDICATIONS AND USAGE , LABORATORY MONITORING , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).",0
119269,42232-9,"Pediatric patients with congenital types of neutropenia (Kostmann’s syndrome, congenital agranulocytosis, or Schwachman-Diamond syndrome) have developed cytogenetic abnormalities and have undergone transformation to MDS and AML while receiving chronic NEUPOGEN® treatment.",0
119270,42232-9,"The relationship of these events to NEUPOGEN® administration is unknown (see WARNINGS , ADVERSE REACTIONS ).",0
119271,42232-9,Long-term follow-up data from the postmarketing surveillance study suggest that height and weight are not adversely affected in patients who received up to 5 years of NEUPOGEN® treatment.,0
119272,42232-9,Limited data from patients who were followed in the phase 3 study for 1.5 years did not suggest alterations in sexual maturation or endocrine function.,0
119273,42232-9,The safety and efficacy in neonates and patients with autoimmune neutropenia of infancy have not been established.,0
119274,42232-9,In the cancer setting‚ 12 pediatric patients with neuroblastoma have received up to 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide‚ cisplatin‚ doxorubicin‚ and etoposide chemotherapy concurrently with NEUPOGEN®; in this population‚ NEUPOGEN® was well tolerated.,0
119275,42232-9,There was one report of palpable splenomegaly associated with NEUPOGEN® therapy; however‚ the only consistently reported adverse event was musculoskeletal pain‚ which is no different from the experience in the adult population.,0
119277,42232-9,"Among 855 subjects enrolled in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of NEUPOGEN® use following myelosuppressive chemotherapy, there were 232 subjects age 65 or older, and 22 subjects age 75 or older.",0
119278,42232-9,"No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other clinical experience has not identified differences in the responses between elderly and younger patients.",0
119279,42232-9,"Clinical studies of NEUPOGEN® in other approved indications (ie, bone marrow transplant recipients, PBPC mobilization, and SCN) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects.",0
119884,34071-1,"The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients.",0
119889,34071-1,"These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.",0

119899,34071-1,"If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION—Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL CR, for a description of the risks of discontinuation of PAXIL CR).",0
119900,34071-1,"Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers.",0
119902,34071-1,"Prescriptions for PAXIL CR should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.",0
119903,34071-1,A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder.,0
119907,34071-1,It should be noted that PAXIL CR is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.,0
119908,34071-1,"In patients receiving another serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug in combination with an MAOI, there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma.",0
119909,34071-1,These reactions have also been reported in patients who have recently discontinued that drug and have been started on an MAOI.,0
119911,34071-1,"While there are no human data showing such an interaction with paroxetine hydrochloride, limited animal data on the effects of combined use of paroxetine and MAOIs suggest that these drugs may act synergistically to elevate blood pressure and evoke behavioral excitation.",0
119912,34071-1,"Therefore, it is recommended that PAXIL CR not be used in combination with an MAOI (including linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).",0
119913,34071-1,At least 2 weeks should be allowed after stopping PAXIL CR before starting an MAOI.,0
119914,34071-1,"The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including treatment with PAXIL CR, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists.",0
119916,34071-1,"Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes.",0
119917,34071-1,Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.,0
119918,34071-1,The concomitant use of PAXIL CR with MAOIs intended to treat depression is contraindicated.,0
119919,34071-1,"If concomitant treatment of PAXIL CR with a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist (triptan) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.",0
119920,34071-1,The concomitant use of PAXIL CR with serotonin precursors (such as tryptophan) is not recommended.,0
119921,34071-1,"Treatment with PAXIL CR and any concomitant serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.",0
119922,34071-1,"Thioridazine administration alone produces prolongation of the QTc interval, which is associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsade de pointes–type arrhythmias, and sudden death.",0
119923,34071-1,This effect appears to be dose related.,0
119924,34071-1,"An in vivo study suggests that drugs which inhibit CYP2D6, such as paroxetine, will elevate plasma levels of thioridazine.",0
119925,34071-1,"Therefore, it is recommended that paroxetine not be used in combination with thioridazine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).",0
119926,34071-1,Teratogenic Effects,0
119927,34071-1,"Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations.",0
119928,34071-1,The findings from these studies are summarized below:,0
119929,34071-1,"A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8).",0
119930,34071-1,No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants.,0
119931,34071-1,The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and atrial septal defects (ASDs).,0
119932,34071-1,Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery.,0
119933,34071-1,"A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine).",0
119934,34071-1,"This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9).",0
119935,34071-1,"Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs.",0
119936,34071-1,This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8).,0
119937,34071-1,"Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with >9,000 birth defect cases and >4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions.",0
119938,34071-1,"In one study the OR was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the OR was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants).",0
119939,34071-1,"Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular, or specific congenital malformations.",0
119940,34071-1,A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) on first trimester paroxetine use in pregnancy and congenital malformations included the above-noted studies in addition to others (n = 17 studies that included overall malformations and n = 14 studies that included cardiovascular malformations; n = 20 distinct studies).,0
119941,34071-1,"While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester.",0
119942,34071-1,"It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which the observed prevalence of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to that of overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to the observed prevalence of all cardiovascular malformations.",0
119943,34071-1,"If a patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, she should be advised of the potential harm to the fetus.",0
119944,34071-1,"Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant (see PRECAUTIONS—Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL CR).",0
119945,34071-1,"For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options.",0
119946,34071-1,Animal Findings,0
119947,34071-1,Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis.,0
119948,34071-1,These doses are approximately 8 (rat) and 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on an mg/m2 basis.,0
119949,34071-1,These studies have revealed no evidence of teratogenic effects.,0
119950,34071-1,"However, in rats, there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation.",0
119951,34071-1,This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day or approximately one-sixth of the MRHD on an mg/m2 basis.,0
119952,34071-1,The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined.,0
119953,34071-1,The cause of these deaths is not known.,0
119954,34071-1,Nonteratogenic Effects,0
119955,34071-1,"Neonates exposed to PAXIL CR and other SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding.",0
119956,34071-1,Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery.,0
119957,34071-1,"Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying.",0
119958,34071-1,"These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome.",0
119959,34071-1,"It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS—Potential for Interaction With Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors).",0
119960,34071-1,Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).,0
119961,34071-1,"PPHN occurs in 1 – 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.",0

139429,42232-9,Special Precautions Regarding Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release 100 mg and 200 mg Tablets,0
139430,42232-9,Morphine sulfate extended-release 100 mg and 200 mg tablets are for use only in opioid-tolerant patients requiring daily morphine equivalent dosages of 200 mg or more for the 100 mg tablet and 400 mg or more for the 200 mg tablet.,0
139431,42232-9,"Care should be taken in its prescription and patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as this may have severe medical consequences for that individual.",0
139433,42232-9,"Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are a controlled-release oral formulation of morphine sulfate indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, around-the-clock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time.",0
139434,42232-9,Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets do not release morphine continuously over the course of a dosing interval.,0
139435,42232-9,The administration of single doses of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets on a q12h dosing schedule will result in higher peak and lower trough plasma levels than those that occur when an identical daily dose of morphine is administered using conventional oral formulations on a q4h regimen.,0
139436,42232-9,The clinical significance of greater fluctuations in morphine plasma level has not been systematically evaluated (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).,0
139437,42232-9,Selection of patients for treatment with morphine sulfate extended-release tablets should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of morphine or other potent opioid analgesics.,0
139438,42232-9,"Specifically, the increased risks associated with its use in the following populations should be considered: the elderly or debilitated and those with severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary, or renal function; myxedema or hypothyroidism; adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison’s Disease); CNS depression or coma; toxic psychosis; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture; acute alcoholism; delirium tremens; kyphoscoliosis or inability to swallow.",0
139439,42232-9,"The administration of morphine, like all opioid analgesics, may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions.",0
139440,42232-9,"Morphine may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings.",0
139441,42232-9,Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics,0
139442,42232-9,"Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as morphine sulfate.",0
139443,42232-9,"In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of morphine sulfate and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.",0
139444,42232-9,Use in Pancreatic-Biliary Tract Disease,0
139445,42232-9,Morphine should be used with caution in patients about to undergo surgery of the biliary tract since it may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi.,0
139446,42232-9,"Similarly, morphine should be used with caution in patients with acute pancreatitis secondary to biliary tract disease.",0
139447,42232-9,Tolerance,0
139448,42232-9,Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug’s effects over time.,0
139449,42232-9,"Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.",0
139450,42232-9,Physical Dependence,0
139451,42232-9,"Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by an opioid specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist.",0
139452,42232-9,"The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, piloerection, myalgia, mydriasis, irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.",0
139453,42232-9,"In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Cessation of Therapy ).",0

139463,42232-9,Patients started on morphine sulfate extended-release tablets or whose dose has been changed should refrain from dangerous activity until it is established that they are not adversely affected.,0
139464,42232-9,"Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets should not be taken with alcohol or other CNS depressants (sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician because dangerous additive effects may occur resulting in serious injury or death.",0
139465,42232-9,Women of childbearing potential who become or are planning to become pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child.,0
139466,42232-9,"Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with morphine sulfate extended-release tablets for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the morphine sulfate extended-release tablet dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms.",0
139469,42232-9,"Special care must be taken to avoid accidental ingestion or the use by individuals (including children) other than the patient for whom it was originally prescribed, as such unsupervised use may have severe, even fatal, consequences.",0
139470,42232-9,Patients should be advised that morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are a potential drug of abuse.,0
139472,42232-9,Patients should be instructed to keep morphine sulfate extended-release tablets in a secure place out of the reach of children.,0

139474,42232-9,Use in Drug and Alcohol Addiction,0
139475,42232-9,Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are an opioid with no approved use in the management of addiction disorders.,0
139478,42232-9,(see also WARNINGS ),0
139479,42232-9,Use with CNS Depressants,0
139480,42232-9,"The concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, and alcohol may produce additive depressant effects.",0
139481,42232-9,"Respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may occur.",0
139483,42232-9,"Opioid analgesics, including morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.",0
139485,42232-9,Studies of morphine sulfate in animals to evaluate the drug’s carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or the effect on fertility have not been conducted.,0
139487,42232-9,Teratogenic Effects – Category C,0
139488,42232-9,Adequate animal studies on reproduction have not been performed to determine whether morphine affects fertility in males or females.,0
139489,42232-9,"There are no well-controlled studies in women, but marketing experience does not include any evidence of adverse effects on the fetus following routine (short-term) clinical use of morphine sulfate products.",0
139490,42232-9,"Although there is no clearly defined risk, such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus.",0
139491,42232-9,"Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets should be used in pregnant women only if the need for strong opioid analgesia clearly outweighs the potential risk to the fetus (see also PRECAUTIONS: Labor and Delivery , and WARNINGS: Drug Abuse and Addiction ).",0
139493,42232-9,Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor.,0
139494,42232-9,"Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions.",0
139495,42232-9,"However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation which tends to shorten labor.",0
139496,42232-9,Neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor should be observed closely for signs of respiratory depression.,0
139498,42232-9,Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome,0
139499,42232-9,Chronic maternal use of opioids during pregnancy can affect the fetus with subsequent withdrawal symptoms.,0
139500,42232-9,"Neonatal withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, abnormal crying, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and subsequent weight loss or failure to gain weight, and may result in death.",0
139501,42232-9,"The onset, duration and severity of neonatal withdrawal syndrome varies based on the drug used, duration of use, the dose of last maternal use, and rate of elimination by the newborn.",0
139502,42232-9,Use standard care as medically appropriate.,0
139504,42232-9,Low levels of morphine have been detected in the breast milk.,0
139505,42232-9,Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breast-feeding infants when maternal administration of morphine sulfate is stopped.,0
139506,42232-9,"Ordinarily, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving morphine sulfate extended-release tablets since morphine may be excreted in the milk.",0
139509,42232-9,"Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are not to be chewed, crushed, dissolved, or divided for administration.",0
139511,42232-9,Clinical studies of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.,0
139711,42232-9,This may result in severe nervous system dam age before the correct diagnosis is made.,0
139714,42232-9,There is evidence that the anti convulsant action of phenytoin is antagonized by folic acid.,0
139715,42232-9,A patient whose epilepsy is completely controlled by phenytoin may require increased doses to prevent convulsions if folic acid is given.,0
139716,42232-9,"Folate deficiency may result from increased loss of folate, as in renal dialysis and/or interference with metabolism (e.g., folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate); the administration of anticonvulsants, such as diphenylhydantoin, primidone, and barbiturates; alcohol consumption and, especially, alcoholic cirrhosis; and the administration of pyrimethamine and nitrofurantoin.",0
139717,42232-9,"False low serum and red cell folate levels may occur if the patient has been taking antibiotics, such as tetracycline, which suppress the growth of Lactobacillus casei.",0
139719,42232-9,Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential and studies to evaluate the mutagenic potential or effect on fertility have not been con ducted.,0
139721,42232-9,Teratogenic Effects,0
139722,42232-9,Pregnancy Category A,0
139723,42232-9,Folic acid is usually indicated in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias of pregnancy.,0
139724,42232-9,"Folic acid requirements are markedly increased during pregnancy, and deficiency will result in fetal damage (see INDICA TIONS AND USAGE).",0
139725,42232-9,Studies in pregnant women have not shown that folic acid increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during pregnancy.,0
139726,42232-9,"If the drug is used during pregnancy, the possibility of fetal harm appears remote.",0
139727,42232-9,"Because studies cannot rule out the possibility of harm, however, folic acid should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.",0
139729,42232-9,Folic acid is excreted in the milk of lactating mothers.,0
139730,42232-9,"During lactation, folic acid requirements are markedly increased; however, amounts present in human milk are adequate to fulfill infant requirements, although supplementation may be needed in low- birth-weight infants, in those who are breast-fed by mothers with folic acid deficiency (50 μg daily), or in those with infections or prolonged diarrhea.",0
139797,42232-9,"Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine, their dosage should be reduced.",0
139798,42232-9,"Since drowsiness may occur with use of this drug, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking hydroxyzine.",0
139801,42232-9,A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of hydroxyzine hydrochloride included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to define a difference in response from younger subjects.,0
139803,42232-9,"In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",0
139804,42232-9,The extent of renal excretion of hydroxyzine hydrochloride has not been determined.,0
139805,42232-9,"Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selections.",0
139806,42232-9,Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydroxyzine hydrochloride and observed closely.,0

139975,42232-9,"Before commencing treatment with PROTOPIC Ointment, cutaneous bacterial or viral infections at treatment sites should be resolved.",0
139976,42232-9,Studies have not evaluated the safety and efficacy of PROTOPIC Ointment in the treatment of clinically infected atopic dermatitis.,0
139977,42232-9,"While patients with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to superficial skin infections including eczema herpeticum (Kaposi’s varicelliform eruption), treatment with PROTOPIC Ointment may be independently associated with an increased risk of varicella zoster virus infection (chicken pox or shingles), herpes simplex virus infection, or eczema herpeticum.",0
139978,42232-9,"In clinical studies, 112/13494 (0.8%) cases of lymphadenopathy were reported and were usually related to infections (particularly of the skin) and noted to resolve upon appropriate antibiotic therapy.",0

1151777,34067-9,Pharmacokinetics,1
1151778,34067-9,Absorption,1
1151779,34067-9,After oral administration >90% of diazepam is absorbed and the average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1 – 1.5 hours with a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours.,1
1151780,34067-9,Absorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal.,1
1151781,34067-9,In the presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 minutes when fasting.,1
1151782,34067-9,There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations to about 2.5 hours in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting.,1
1151783,34067-9,This results in an average decrease in Cmax of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in AUC (range 15% to 50%) when administered with food.,1
1151784,34067-9,Distribution,1
1151785,34067-9,Diazepam and its metabolites are highly bound to plasma proteins (diazepam 98%).,1
1151786,34067-9,Diazepam and its metabolites cross the blood-brain and placental barriers and are also found in breast milk in concentrations approximately one tenth of those in maternal plasma (days 3 to 9 post-partum).,1
1151787,34067-9,"In young healthy males, the volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.8 to 1.0 L/kg.",1
1151788,34067-9,The decline in the plasma concentration-time profile after oral administration is biphasic.,1
1151789,34067-9,"The initial distribution phase has a half-life of approximately 1 hour, although it may range up to >3 hours.",1
1151790,34067-9,Metabolism,1
1151791,34067-9,"Diazepam is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and 2C19 to the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam, and is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite temazepam.",1
1151792,34067-9,N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam are both further metabolized to oxazepam.,1
1151793,34067-9,Temazepam and oxazepam are largely eliminated by glucuronidation.,1
1151794,34067-9,Elimination,1
1151795,34067-9,The initial distribution phase is followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase (half-life up to 48 hours).,1
1151796,34067-9,The terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam is up to 100 hours.,1
1151797,34067-9,"Diazepam and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their glucuronide conjugates.",1
1151798,34067-9,The clearance of diazepam is 20 to 30 mL/min in young adults.,1
1151799,34067-9,Diazepam accumulates upon multiple dosing and there is some evidence that the terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged.,1
1151800,34067-9,Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations,1
1151802,34067-9,In children 3 - 8 years old the mean half-life of diazepam has been reported to be 18 hours.,1
1151803,34067-9,Newborns,1
1151804,34067-9,"In full term infants, elimination half-lives around 30 hours have been reported, with a longer average half-life of 54 hours reported in premature infants of 28 - 34 weeks gestational age and 8 - 81 days post-partum.",1
1151805,34067-9,In both premature and full term infants the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam shows evidence of continued accumulation compared to children.,1
1151806,34067-9,Longer half-lives in infants may be due to incomplete maturation of metabolic pathways.,1
1151807,34067-9,Geriatric,1
1151808,34067-9,Elimination half-life increases by approximately 1 hour for each year of age beginning with a half-life of 20 hours at 20 years of age.,1
1151809,34067-9,This appears to be due to an increase in volume of distribution with age and a decrease in clearance.,1
1151810,34067-9,"Consequently, the elderly may have lower peak concentrations, and on multiple dosing higher trough concentrations.",1
1151811,34067-9,It will also take longer to reach steady-state.,1
1151812,34067-9,Conflicting information has been published on changes of plasma protein binding in the elderly.,1
1151813,34067-9,Reported changes in free drug may be due to significant decreases in plasma proteins due to causes other than simply aging.,1
1151814,34067-9,Hepatic Insufficiency,1
1151815,34067-9,"In mild and moderate cirrhosis, average half-life is increased.",1
1151816,34067-9,"The average increase has been variously reported from 2-fold to 5-fold, with individual half-lives over 500 hours reported.",1
1151817,34067-9,"There is also an increase in volume of distribution, and average clearance decreases by almost half.",1
1151818,34067-9,"Mean half-life is also prolonged with hepatic fibrosis to 90 hours (range 66 - 104 hours), with chronic active hepatitis to 60 hours (range 26 - 76 hours), and with acute viral hepatitis to 74 hours (range 49 - 129).",1

1177283,34067-9,Wilson’s Disease - Wilson’s disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) results from the interaction of an inherited defect and an abnormality in copper metabolism.,1
1177284,34067-9,"The metabolic defect, which is the consequence of the autosomal inheritance of one abnormal gene from each parent, manifests itself in a greater positive copper balance than normal.",1
1177285,34067-9,"As a result, copper is deposited in several organs and appears eventually to produce pathologic effects most prominently seen in the brain, where degeneration is widespread; in the liver, where fatty infiltration, inflammation, and hepatocellular damage progress to postnecrotic cirrhosis; in the kidney, where tubular and glomerular dysfunction results; and in the eye, where characteristic corneal copper deposits are known as Kayser-Fleischer rings.",1

1177288,34067-9,Treatment has two objectives:,1
1177289,34067-9,(1) to minimize dietary intake and absorption of copper.,1
1177290,34067-9,(2) to promote excretion of copper deposited in tissues.,1
1177291,34067-9,The first objective is attained by a daily diet that contains no more than one or two milligrams of copper.,1
1177292,34067-9,"Such a diet should exclude, most importantly, chocolate, nuts, shellfish, mushrooms, liver, molasses, broccoli, and cereals enriched with copper, and be composed to as great an extent as possible of foods with a low copper content.",1
1177293,34067-9,Distilled or demineralized water should be used if the patient’s drinking water contains more than 0.1 mg of copper per liter.,1
1177294,34067-9,"For the second objective, a copper chelating agent is used.",1
1177295,34067-9,"In symptomatic patients, this treatment usually produces marked neurologic improvement, fading of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and gradual amelioration of hepatic dysfunction and psychic disturbances.",1
